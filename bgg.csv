743429,Al Capwnd You,8,One of the best-written rule sets to a game I have seen. Everything is very clearly explained. All roles feel fun to play and are useful. Simpler in complexity compared to Pandemic. This would be my suggestion for a cooperative gateway game.,136063,Forbidden Desert

It is challenging for adults and hard core gamers, yet children (not real young) can play.  We played recently and my 7 year old son won and we didn't let him either.  I couldn't believe it!  It also plays shorter (or at least seems to) than indicated on the box.  The main thing is when the game is over ALL of us wish it would've lasted longer - this game never drags on.

It is extremely intense.  It is unpredictable.  What don&#039;t I like about this game?  It&#039;s an elimnation game - meaning a person gets eliminated now what do they do?  It can be very long.  An angry player can kamikazee you for any reason and basically you&#039;re best laid plans are finished and some knucklehead who didn&#039;t know what he was doing walks away with the win.

I also really liked the art design on the board (nice use of fonts). I wanted to play again before my first game was even finished actually. It is very well designed (I liked the way the economy worked and was impressed with how much thought must have went into the board layout) and it had a very fluid gameplay which is something I appreciate. Wow.",2651,Power Grid
765217,Al Stech,9,"I've played this many times on BSW and finally got a chance to play the real thing. It's a great game with a really interesting mechanic. It plays fast and you can employ a huge variety of strategies. My only problems with the game are that the various money denominations -- copper/silver/gold -- are all uniformly copper in colour, some of the artwork is terrible (the militia card is atrocious), and the back of the cards is a horrible blue colour with an awkwardly placed double logo. I'm sure that this game will see many card expansions, but I wish instead for a second edition with proper artwork and card backs.",36218,Dominion

789502,Alakazander,9,"This game means so many different things to so many different people, it is almost impossible to give an accurate rating... It's a behemoth in the industry, and practically a society unto itself. Not only are there numerous formats for both constructed and limited play, there are variant and unofficial formats that wax and wane in popularity, local metagames, unofficial bannings and impromptu nerfs; to use a cliche term, there are millions of people who play Magic, and there is probably that many different ways to play the game.  I don't know if one can separate the game from the culture, media, and shared memories surrounding it. Some use the game as a way to experience the world that they read about in the books and comics, while others go to tournaments as an outlet for competition. For many it sparked that initial creative spark that led them to game design, not only through creating interesting decks, but also by making custom cards and formats.  My rating reflects both my genuine enjoyment with the core game itself, regardless of the ups and downs with whatever meta for a particular format, and the local community that I became a part of.  As a final note, a deck that just jams all of the most expensive cards will be trounced by a deck that is well-tuned. Hell, what is considered the best deck is often not even the most expensive, as seen in Legacy and Vintage. It does however require a substantial initial investment if you want to be tournament ready. That initial investment can be maintained through aggressive trading cards like stocks, but at that point you have to treat the game like a second part-time job. It is fine if people don't want to deal with he money/time investment to be competitive, but I don't know if I'd call it ""pay to win"".",463,Magic: The Gathering
851024,Alakazander,9,,124742,Android: Netrunner
896482,Alakazander,8.5,"First and foremost: this game is fantastic. Easily one of the best gateway games of all time, and still a great casual option for downtime after a day of work.  I wish the game took up a bit less space as that would allow it to be played at a restaurant or at work, but I understand that other concessions would have to be made and don't really fault it for that. More of ""in a perfect world"" sort of comment.  What I do find unacceptable, however, is that sometimes the pieces do not fit together, and you have to occasionally jam one piece so that it ""slots"" into another.",163412,Patchwork

800,Alan Kwan,10,"A worthy game for the innovative turn-sequence system alone - and there's more.  The game also combines the ""multiple paths to victory"" as in Princes of Florence, and the ""break normal game rules"" aspect of some CCGs (or Cosmic Encounter, Ursuppe/Urland etc.) in the form of purple building functions.  (And yes, the buildings can be very powerful.)  And yet the balance between the various game elements (building costs etc.) seems to be just right, so that there is no single obvious winning strategy (at least it seems so) nor elements which become useless because they're too weak.  A most excellent, finely-crafted game.  Perhaps the best of 2002, my bet for DSP winner.",3076,Puerto Rico

121425,Alan Kwan,10,"The game balance/card balance is a godsend.  We can really see the fruits of the efforts spent on design and playtesting.  It is really amazing that there are so many different cards with different powers, yet none seems too strong or too weak (for their costs).  In this aspect RtfG has surpassed even Puerto Rico and San Juan.  Because the card balance is good and the cards are so varied, you can play many intricate combos besides the obvious ones, so the game has lots of variations and hence, longevity.  Being a card game with admittedly some luck, this game may not be very good as a /competition/ (GIPF project games do that better, for example), but as a game and /entertainment/ I couldn't ask for more.",28143,Race for the Galaxy

1770,Alan Stern,10,"I absolutely love this game!  It strikes an excellent balance between planning (strategy) and response (tactics).  I like how the combat/pvp nature of the game is well balanced - there is such a dual-edged nature to combat that players think long and hard before committing to them and it can be strategically advantageous to eat a loss rather than over commit and obtain a victory.  In addition (and this is for games of 3+ players), you have to consider how winning 1 combat weakens your overall ability to defend yourself and opens you up to combat from other players.  It really is well done.  I also like the engine building.  It's not a complicated engine, but the operations required to establish the engine and utilize it are varied enough that players have many choices to make.  In addition, those choices tend to be very deep - they are the tip of the iceberg, a snowball that may or may not lead to the ultimate goal (global world domination or something like that).  It's the depth of gameplay that keeps me coming back.  I like the dual nature of upgrades.  You uncover a benefit and cover a cost.  It's such a nice way of offering compelling, meaningful choices with real consequences.  The variance in starting position/mats is fantastic!  The combination of faction + player mat makes for some real differences in terms of the best strategy to utilize.  And then you have to consider the goals, which may or may not be worth pursuing.  Plenty of choices!  I love the art in this game.  Pastoral and very thematic.  The illustrations help frame the game in a larger context.  It wasn't strictly necessary, and not everyone likes or enjoys it, but I think it adds character to the bigger package and presentation.  Production value is excellent!  Even the base game is high quality.  The additional pieces (metal coins, board extension, realistic resource tokens) are much appreciated!  I strongly recommend using glass markers/beads in place of the cardboard exploration tokens.  The cardboard tokens get lost among the board's colorful artwork.  3d beads are *MUCH* easier to see and improve gameplay.  My primary criticism is that games will often end with an unequal number of turns.  This is something that [u][url=https://boardgamegeek.com/article/23299059#23299059]I discussed in the forums[/url][/u].  I have two ""answers"" for this point.  My first inclination, as suggested by sethvanorden in that thread, is to use turn order as a handy cap modifier.  Very easy and very understandable.  My second thought is to give a small compensation to those players who received one less turn - an award on the order of 5 coins or so.  Small, insufficient, but enough to reduce the sting and say ""I feel your pain but I'm not giving you 100% insurance coverage.""  I think either or both of those will help.  Overall, this is just a fantastic game.  I think there's enough depth to keep me interested for a long time without overwhelming players.  Also, the play time hits a sweet, [i]sweet[/i] spot - 2 hours once people are familiar.  There are potential swings and not everything is 100% balanced, but it shouldn't be.  This is not a pure abstract - it's a thematic euro.  You want it unbalanced enough to provide options, but not so off-kilter that the whole system wobbles out of control.  And it hits that spot beautifully.  Try it.  [gameid=169786] may or may not be your cup o' tea, but I'd give it better than even odds that you see and appreciate at least some of its carefully crafted beauty.",169786,Scythe
12138,Alan Stern,10,"I love this game!  There are a number of subtle strategies and techniques.  There's a lot to be said for either using a strategy from which your opponent(s) can't leech or using a strategy that leeches from your opponent(s).  Some games, it really does become a race to win.  I'm enjoying this more and more and expect to keep enjoying it for the foreseeable future.  I'm also rather addicted to it.  (Race anyone?  Race?)  ADDENDUM:  While I understand Race may not be for everyone (steep learning curve, mucho symbology to learn, lots to figure out), it is definitely my game of choice.  Deep gameplay and the many, varied options and strategies keep me coming back.  At +100 plays, I will gladly play more and I feel like I'm still picking up various nuances.  I can't wait for the expansions!  (Seriously, I can't wait.  WTT [insert something extremely precious and valuable] for an advanced copy.  Void where prohibited by law, good taste or insobriety.)  This rating is for the base game (i.e., without expansions).  I played the base game a lot (looks like 224 plays) and came to enjoy it.  The expansions, even the first one with only 22 more cards, dramatically change the game.  The strategies, the directions, the feel -- they just play differently.  Some elements are improved while others are diminished.  (4/09/09)  NOTE (10/02/13):  Base game is excellent!  It really is fantastic on its own.  1st expansion is okay but not solid.  2nd expansion fleshes things out further and is very good.  3rd (final) expansion is the icing on the cake.  The combined product (base + 3 exp) is excellent!!!  Still, I rate the base a 10 and the others less (8-9) because the base alone is a complete, and wonderful, game all on its own.",28143,Race for the Galaxy

It's a great later-in-the-night, non-serious game.  More experiential than anything, but the game elements are tight enough to establish purpose and benchmarks.

263293,Alan Stern,9,"This expansion is more like ""Dominion: Round Two.""  The new cards are *extremely* nice.  Possibly overpowering in a few respects, but they shore up some of the weaknesses in the base game.  I like how they mix up the gameplay and change things.  The combo cards (VP + something else) are very nice, while the new attack cards are just mean!  Best effect likely obtained by mixing this with the first/base game.  Still not deep or strategic enough for me to rate a 10.  Can be pretty random and unforgiving.  Some of the cards in this expansion flat out improve on cards in the base set with the most notable one being the Ironworks vs. the Workshop.  Why would I bother with the Workshop ever again?  The expansion totally outmodes some base cards and that doesn't strike me as a good thing nor as a good game model.  An excellent game that is well worth playing.  I like this one better than the base game.  Improves on it in almost every respect.  People new to this ""series"" should probably start with the base game as it is simpler and, more likely, easier to follow.  For those of us experienced with the base game, this expansion simply rocks!",40834,Dominion: Intrigue

364961,Alan Stern,9,"An interesting game of worker placement and building/ship construction.  Similar to [GAMEID=31260] in a few respects (e.g., food requirement, action selection, blocking other players), but more economic since it includes buying/selling and a lot of goods conversion (upgrading).  I like it.  It feels tighter in some ways, potentially harsher than [GAMEID=31260] but more flexible.  Need additional plays to really pin it down.  Game length is an issue, though it should become less prohibitive with experienced players.  Rating may improve with additional plays.  Rating bumped from 7 to 8 (4/27/09).  The more I play this, the more I want to play it.  My first 4 plays have been of the shorter variety (a 3-p, two solo's & a 4-p).  I'm liking it more and more, appreciating the different strategies or, at the very least, the different directions.  I suspect this one will shine even more in the longer variety with the special buildings.  Rating bumped from 8 to 9 (5/08/09).  I like this one [i]much[/i] better than [GAMEID=31260].  There is a definite progression to the game due to the expanding ""tech tree"" and increasing number of options as buildings are constructed.  There are a few different strategies to consider.  Food, and entry fees, can become a severe limiting factor, but there are a few ways to anticipate this and plan accordingly.  The biggest downsides are game length and having to use the short version for intro games.  Further comments (5/29/09).  The long game is *MUCH* better than the short game.  There's a greater sense of development and resources in the early portion become more critical.  In addition, the special buildings make the game more diverse and differentiated among plays.  That's another interesting thing -- the game can vary a lot among plays, and not just from player choices.  Order and arrangement of the building piles, order of the 7 turn supply markers, the special buildings at work -- these all combine to produce very different, diverse games.  I want to play more long games.  I am [i]really[/i] enjoying this game!  (It's better than [gameid=31260]!  *gasp*)  More comments (6/29/09):  The long game is the only/best way to go.  I'm now teaching others with the long game.  Much better than the short game.  The special buildings have the potential for dictating, or at least suggesting, new avenues to pursue.  While shipping & building are the two dominant strategies, there are so many flavors to pursue and options to consider that I'm not losing interest at all.  Plano-type boxes are a must for short setup time.  Check out the sewing section at your local craft store for small boxes.  Negatives:  Play time is a bit long for the game.  Fair bit of downtime on other players' turns.  Don't play with the AP-inclined.  Relatively steep learning curve -- lots to learn, assimilate and assess.  Still, I really like this one and I don't see that changing any time soon.  Additional comments (7/08/09):  Teaching this game is difficult.  There's a lot to cover and new players' eyes will likely glaze over at the 5 or 10 min. mark.  Unfortunately, there's not much that can be done about that.  In addition, experienced players will have a dramatic advantage over new players.  There's a distinct learning curve that some people may not traverse or may not be willing to traverse.  I think there's a great game on the other side, but not all will agree or be willing to play this one again.",35677,Le Havre

695690,Alan Stern,9,"CCG deck building without all the CCG ugliness.  25 action cards mean lots of combinations, lots of replay.  One complaint is that an unmitigated Chapel deck destroys.  However, it's still an excellent game and, if the Chapel really bothers you, don't put it in!  We usually draft the majority of the action cards (e.g., draw 2/3, keep 1) and use a veto system for the remainder.  Usually works well.  I love this game!  Plays quick, fair bit of strategy, and the luck factor can be mitigated (to a degree) by your strategy.  Luck still plays a big role, but as with [GAMEID=28143] a skilled player will generally win (or is more likely to win) over a lesser-skilled player.  Rated a 9 instead of a 10 because I've lost interest in it.  I'll gladly play it if someone else suggests it or wants to, but it's nowhere near a ""must play"" for me anymore, and I feel as though I have a good handle on strategies.  I win around half the time and almost all of my games are 3-4 players.  Give this one a shot and see if it scratches the itch for you.  By the way, for all Dominion I've grown to prefer an even number of turns and phantom Provinces on the last turn (if the Provinces run out then).  It evens everything out and reduces the otherwise significant advantage afforded by turn order.",36218,Dominion

Yes, it's fun, but it plays out in a similar manner each game and the biggest differentiation is in which role you have this time.  In addition, there's a distinct potential for a leader or dominant force to arise and take control (though this can occur with almost any coop).

721589,Alan Stern,9,"Excellent game!  Brings a fantastic RPG feel to tabletop gaming.  I like how the deck building aspect drives the game (your options and available choices) without diluting the RPG elements.  Reasons I don't rate this higher:  (1)  Rules are not for the faint of heart (but it is emulating a RPG, so you should be expecting some rules complexity).  (2)  Not a fast play.  Yes, subsequent plays will increase speed, but the game does not lend itself to fast play.  Expect long games of this.  (3)  Bad luck early on carries through.  The rich get richer.  Success breeds success.  No catch up mechanism.  (How many different ways can I say the same thing?)  Notwithstanding the above, really an excellent game!  9/01/13:  Upping my rating to a 9.  (1) becomes better with repeated plays, as does (2).  (3) is true, but you have to be willing to push things and take some wounds.  Not the end of the world if the mob goes down, not at all.

Last man standing vs. kill all the bad guys vs. don't let the Sheriff die?  In my opinion, better with more people though also a bit more confusing and crazy (which is, of course, more fun!).  Rating lowered from 8 to 7.  A good game, but not one I look to play.  The game mechanics leave me feeling like gameplay is random and hard to control.

807579,Alan Stern,9,"Such an interesting one!  The varied player powers and costs, along with the round chit thingies, vary the game nicely.  In addition, those competing desires to be next to others and yet not have them snap up your real estate.  I want to play this more.  6/05/13:  Upgraded to a 9.  LOVE THIS ONE!  Repeated plays bear out the awesomeness.  The 14 factions are cool, but it's the variability in the round bonuses and the turn tiles (whatever they're called) that make this worth playing again and again.  Plus (almost) everyone I introduce it to has enjoyed it.  One guy is lukewarm.  Very well done!  By the way, negatives (aka reasons this isn't a 10 for me):  (1) Game length.  This takes a long time to play though I think it's worth the effort/time.  (2) Lack of speed for player turns.  What other players do can influence what you do, thus making advance planning of your turn difficult at times.  This slows down play and is mildly unavoidable.  (3) The screwage is distinctly annoying.  Where does it occur?  Snapping up power actions and real estate, outflanking on the religion tracks, and in the number of cities.  I *really* dislike the limited number of cities in a 5-player game.  With 4 players, it's very unlikely to be an issue or ever come up.  With 5 players, it's unavoidable and devastating.  You can't wait on forming your cities and, if someone beats you by getting their 3rd (which I've seen happen), you may be out of the game.  Which stinks.

I love the concept and the game serves as an excellent way to cooperate with your friends. It's so fun and stressful at the same time, that it's just impossible not to love it. The best part is that you can carry it wherever you want since the box is extremely small.  My rating was going to be 10, but the game has a little issue. It's too difficult to follow the rules and don't give extra information while talking, and playing in complete silence would be just boring.",98778,Hanabi
510319,alanhernesto,9,"I bought this as my first modern board game, with the idea of playing it with my friends in school between classes. We also invite some other classmates to play if they have some free time.  Everyone has loved it! The idea of getting as much information as you can when you are a resistance member, or doing your best at lying when you are a spy is amazing. The best part is that, as you can't decide your alliance nor be sure of the others' one, it's extremely rare for two plays to be the same.  The only problem is that spies win too often, especially if the players are good liars. But even if the game is kind of unbalanced it is always fun to play it, just to see your friends shouting and distrusting everyone.",41114,The Resistance

The game has great replay value because it has 50 different scenarios. The rules are fairly simple and it's an easy game to get started. I love the board building mechanic. The game does, however, lack a bit in balance. Depending on how the board is laid out before the traitor is revealed, the game can be easy or hard for either the traitor or the survivors.

162738,alaskacobalt,10,"This game is made for ages 12+, but there is no way I would play this game with anyone under 18. The rules are very complex and if the 12 year old ends up being the ""traitor"" then the game is going to be VERY rough. This game is VERY difficult to win. It requires a lot of strategy but the monsters are so overpowered that it is extremely difficult to win without a very well thought out plan. Unfortunately, it is really hard to figure out your strategy because it takes a while to figure out what you are actually up against because the ""traitor"" can only give you so much information, which means you have to learn over time.   The game is great. Has good replay, but is definitely more fun playing with people that have played this style of cooperative game before. I recommend starting with a game called ""horrified"". It is a lot less complicated but very similar themes and ideas. I personally think Betrayal is a top 5 game for me, but the rules can be a bit brutal for new players as it isn't always easy to explain them because they change. Definitely need to play at least 2-3 rounds to fully get into the game and appreciate it.",10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill

2058,Albarc,10,Excelent and beatiful abstract. So easy to teach and so engaging (both visually and game wise) that it has seen a lot of table since I got it. So far it is holding pretty-well the hype and presure.,230802,Azul
7096,Albarc,10,Very good game. I like all the rondel/Gerdts games that I have played. This does not have a rondel but is compiting with Imperial as the best Gerdt's game.,124361,Concordia
41258,Albarc,10,"I had this game for a while and never paid it too much attention. ""Too mathy"" - I thought after my first game (2 player, bad choice I know). But then I started looking for a meaty game for six players and it came along. I still think that it is fiddly and mathy, but I like it and now I always look forward to my next game.",2651,Power Grid
58552,Albarc,10,Very good game. I should play it more often. I like it more after each game.,93,El Grande
60442,Albarc,10,"First I was reluctant, but finally I embraced the Agricola's rave. Interesting for both experienced and new players due to the angst to feed your family. I have played mostly the basic game; therefore I have a lot to learn with the advance game (it seems that I am one of the few persons that does not like the designer's solution to give replayability to the game: 14 initial and different cards per player to choose from).",31260,Agricola
77681,Albarc,10,"An unusual game from Knizia but nevertheless excellent. It takes a while to learn how to play well and, when played with newbies, I have to repeat some of the rules several dozens times over a single game. Rewarding nevertheless. It does not get old.",42,Tigris & Euphrates
90358,Albarc,10,Deserved number one. Set-up is a pain and it would certainly need some improvement on the art department (I like and usually play with the illustrated buildings available in the files section). Always a hit with the newbies that survive the explanation of the rules. Good with any number from two (see official variant) to five (I have even tried six).,3076,Puerto Rico

250102,Albarc,9,Gift Good party game. Very attractive for non gamers.,39856,Dixit
270682,Albarc,9,Good and fast 2-player game.,163412,Patchwork
372572,Albarc,9,"Slightly more complex than the original Dominion. The biggest difference is the presence of more cards with double function (Victory/Action, Victory/Tresor, etc) and the presence, in general, of more text in the cards. I was initially skeptical and preferred Dominion cards, but once I got used to the Intrigue cards, I think that they offer more variety.",40834,Dominion: Intrigue
598053,Albarc,9,I like it and I want to play it more often. It is basically language independent but still having the German edition is likely the main reason for choosing other games over this. I should get the Spanish or English edition.,28143,Race for the Galaxy
625980,Albarc,9,"Acquired on June 10, 2002. As for many, this is the game that re-introduced me to boardgames. Well, I suppose that I really never left, therefore, I did not need to be re-introduced, but this was the game that showed me the way to BGG and opened up a world with thousands of boardgames waiting to be played. Still one of my first choice to introduce the boardgaming world to occasional tourists.",13,Catan
637288,Albarc,9,"I borrowed from a friend and we liked it. Fast and interesting game. In some aspects better than the original 7 Wonders. Not long after I got my own copy. After more games, I still think that is an excellent 2-player game.",173346,7 Wonders Duel

704488,Albarc,8,"Good and fast dice game. For me, initially, Sagrada lost the competition with Azul, but both are good and quick abstract games for up to four players that deserve a space in my collection.",199561,Sagrada
728935,Albarc,8,Traded Very short game that can be fun with a large group. Much better than Werewolf in my opinion (without elimination). My initial impression after two games with 7 players is that is much easier to win if you are in the Resistence. ,41114,The Resistance
821361,Albarc,8,I like the artwork better than in original The resistance.,128882,The Resistance: Avalon
884391,Albarc,9,"I borrowed it from a friend and played quite a few 2-player games in a few days. When I returned it, I bought Dominion: Intrigue to try something different. I do not regret, but I would not mind to own Dominion as well. Update: I got it in a mathtrade. ",36218,Dominion

The base game and the three expansions I mentioned are more than enough to keep the game a solid staple in my collection for the duration.",40834,Dominion: Intrigue
969766,albcann,9,"Mage Knight is a very good game.  I've played a lot of games in a very saturated field (fantasy battle) and this one carves out a unique niche and carves it out very well.  It plays so smoothly from start to finish.  It manages to combine a board game with a Magic The Gathering feel (without having the break the bank on new cards) and deck building.  It has a great solitaire system built in, it can be played cooperatively and it can be played competitively.    Complexity:  Don't let it scare you off!  It is far less complex than it has been made out to be.  The game teaches you how to play using a walkthrough while using the rules as a reference rather than something to read cover to cover.  There are also many tutorials on the net that will help.  The complexity lies in the strategy and how best to utilize your cards and resources.    Demerits:  I see two that are worth mentioning.  First, the components are not great quality (as has been stated before).  The cards bend easily and the tiles warp and don't sit flush on the table.  This is a minor quibble, however.  Secondly, will this game get old quickly?  There are a limited number of scenarios and the game expansions don't add a ton of variety.  To be fair, I've only played solo so the game might play completely differently with other players (I suspect it does).  And also to be fair, it hasn't gotten ""old"" for me yet and I've been playing for a while so these two concerns may be baseless.  ",96848,Mage Knight Board Game

74215,Albert Tottleman,10,"Pros:  Great theme, very challenging, adjustable difficulty.  Expandability.  Replayability.  This game beats Arkham Horror for me in the coop category for several reasons.  1.) less fiddliness.  2.) more randomish surprise elements...leading to more varied play experiences.  3.) the fight to survive feels more real, and the desire to play again to do better is there.  Cons:  Can be difficult to adjust the difficulty to where it is a challenge without being an impossibility.  Rules book is bad.  Do yourself a favor and download the many helpful pdfs on the geek that people have posted, this saves much time and aggravation.  All or nearly all of the rules information *is* in the book, but its not laid out logically leading to frustration.    I have played this so far solo, and solo as 4 chars.  I find solo to be very hard, also I found solo as 4 chars very hard.  However, Solo as 4 chars + Friday & dog made the game challenging without the sense of impossibility.  I like this aspect.  I will be playing this with my nieces soon, and it will be good to keep Friday and the dog for that playthrough due to them (the girls) making sub-optimal choices due to lack of experience, and so I won't feel like I will have to alpha-game it just to survive.  This is a big point.  The alpha-gamer trait will rise in the alpha-gamer if he/she feels that they will lose without optimal choices.  If, however, there is a sufficient buffer of sub-optimal play choices, the alpha gamer trait will be rendered tolerable (this is my theory).  ",121921,Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island

The turn is card management: you draw a number of cards and then move and take an action as your cards allow it. The combat system is very nice and usually won`t give you a bloodless fight.

Terra Mystica is a game with very little luck that rewards strategic planning. Each player governs one of the 14 groups. With subtlety and craft the player must attempt to rule as great an area as possible and to develop that group's skills. There are also four religious cults in which you can progress. To do all that each group has special skills and abilities. Taking turns the players execute their actions on the resources they have at their disposal. Different buildings allow players to develop different resources. Dwellings allow for more workers. Trading houses allow players to make money. Strongholds unlock a group's special ability and temples allow you to develop religion and your terraforming and seafaring skills. Buildings can be upgraded: Dwellings can be developed into trading houses; trading houses can be developed into strongholds or temples; one temple can be upgraded to become a sanctuary. Each group must also develop its terraforming skill and its skill with boats to use the rivers. It is the ultimate eurogame for me at least.,120677,Terra Mystica

The 'reckoning' effects are excellent. What at first may appear to be a fairly minor condition or even an asset can turn sour, in some cases starting a chain of further conditions and reckonings that given time and enough bad luck eventually spirals down to catastrophe.   The various encounter decks in the base game are quite limited and they're easy to burn through in a single session. However this is addressed by the Forsaken Lore expansion.

I've found people who dislike Settlers or Dominion, but no one who really dislikes Ticket to Ride, and most love it. My PARENTS will play it! Probably helps that the base game is the USA map. Won the Spiel des Jahres. Rated a little higher than others because it's really easy to explain. Rules: http://www.daysofwonder.com/tickettoride/en/content/rules_tt/",9209,Ticket to Ride

All of the suspicion, accusation, finger-pointing and treachery of a game like BSG or SOC, but all turns are taken together and everyone is involves in every play. After learning the rules, my friends and I were completing a game in 20 mins and coming back for more.  The only markdown is on balance.  In standard rules, the spys win very regularly. Even with a slight imbalance, it was a blast seeing how each game would play out. If you're interested in a more balanced game I'd recommend playing the 'blind spy' variant.   EDIT: I retract my imbalance comment towards spies. Turns out we were just doing it wrong. Remember people, vote teams down!",41114,The Resistance

Settlers has so much room for change with the unique board for every game, and the complete arbitrariness of luck on the dice roles that I almost never get tired of playing. The game is great both for 3 or 4 players, with each situation providing for a very different kind of game. It's also possible to combine two sets of the game to play with 5-7 players (though I wouldn't recommend going over 6), and without needing to buy any of the expensive expansions. Every time I introduce a friend to this game, they get hooked by about half-way through the first game. Settlers is a great strategy game which doesn't rely solely on brute force and has no military based. Rather, one relies on trading resources as well as timely and intelligent use of them buy, barter and build one's way to victory. Highly addicting, but you'll never regret getting hooked!",13,Catan

I own and enjoyed the original Mansions of Madness, and while I do sometimes miss the ability to play against someone who can make intelligent decisions against you based on the board state, I still feel that what it adds makes it a much better game. Top among them is the fact that that you can no longer see all of the map and instead have to explore it as you go. This small change makes it more thematic, adds surprise to the game, and reduces dramatically the setup time. The game is simple enough that even people playing it for the first time will quickly understand it, while still letting you make relevant decisions.",205059,Mansions of Madness: Second Edition

The only reason that is not on my table more often is because we don't have the third player and it's kinda of hard to introduce to non-gamers. We introduced it to friends and family, some loved right away and some lost the interest in the middle of the game. Because of that I would say this is a Medium to Medium-Light weight, definitely not for everyone.  But it will always be my favorite! I guess most people feel that way about their gateway games. :)",1927,Munchkin

This version adds Percival specifically, which gives another role for the good guys to play as. And, although my first play didn't get to use it, Lancelot, Excalibur, and lady of the lake add more things to give information to the good guys.  All in all, whether this stays a highly rated game for me depends on how hard it is to get it to the table. ",128882,The Resistance: Avalon
337029,alenen,9,"1st play: We played the full first campaign from start to finish and it was awesome.  The story is engaging, the twists and turns are surprising and the production and art tie everything together.  This is the experience that I was hoping to get from Pandemic Legacy, and it's honestly a lot better.  I don't mind that each story is only playable once, because 4 people were enteretained for 4 hours, making this game a great deal compared to other forms of entertainment.  I'm a little apprehensive because I've heard that other stories aren't as good as the first, and I really want that not to be true.  But this game is a must-play, the experience is unmatched.",146508,T.I.M.E Stories

The basic game of trying to get to the top floor without getting blocked is interesting enough and the god powers ramp it up. A little of the 'Glory to Rome' feeling where it seems like every power is too strong. Like any good abstract you have to balance defensive blocking with trying to win and not get yourself boxed in.   2nd play: Played 3p and the game continues to shine.  Looks amazing on the table with fun variable player powers which shake up the game without making it chaotic.  Not much else to say except that it's an excellent abstract game that I'm happy to play anytime.",194655,Santorini

513724,alepsycho,9,"It was the first scy fi game I've played, and I have a very good care of this one, it is relatively simple and elegant, beautiful.  The best part in this game is the way you build the blueprints of your ships, researching tecnology to build new wepon, shield, computer, energy source, hull. The customization of your ship and build for combat is great.  The way you track the incomming of the resources is very elegant, too, despite of the long setup.  Tecnology track is good, but there is an unecessary randomness here, the way to mitigate this is trying to be the first player, to guarantee the best tecnology available first. The alternate order of play variant, or the order of pass play variant makes this even better and fair. The only problem here is that some key strategies may not work if you need an advanced economy, or advanced science, mining.  The exploration is very interesting and makes the game change every new play. Of course you can be stuck if you find just ancient ships in the first round and be surrounded by them and be not possible to colonize the new sectors discovered. But in the other hand when you fight them, if you fight them earlier, you have a good chance to collect better reputation.  The combat is simple and functional, and have lots of modifiers depending on the type of wepon, quantity of cannons, difference between the computer and the shield and of course the thick of the hulls.  The different races put an assimetry of play in this game, after some plays it seems balanced.  I love to play this game.",72125,Eclipse

I usually enjoy abstracts very much, but this one is amazing, the game is very simple and clever by itself, and the gods powers put this game into another level with a lot of replayability.

691866,alepsycho,9,"I already enjoyed learning other game from Alexander Pfister this year, Mombasa, and I though I would like this almost same complexity game. And I liked it even more than Mombasa, the reason is that I think things are more organic in this game, the interaction between players and between the lots of stuff you need to take care and the correlation between them.  It is a brilliant design that have a lot of cool mechanics into a very cool game. And the theme, in spite of being pasted, makes even more sense than Mombasa does.  Another thing that I liked is that there are a lot of paths for victory, a lot of strategies and a feeling that you are still playing and giving your best even when knowing you cannot win anymore, that feeling is great for a game that is supposed to be fun for everyone.  Highly recommended.",193738,Great Western Trail

759770,alepsycho,8.5,"Great game, I read a lot of people complaining about the AP, I played the game in 4, with 2 friends that are known by their apness and simply the game passed the test. We managed to play this game in about 50 minutes. Very interesting game, good mechanics, simple, with enough depth. The art is amazing, like almost every art from Days of Wonder.  Edit: After a game in 2 players I decided to give it a push forward on the rating. Great game in 2 players, plays a little different, you can make powerful combos that make the game even more interesting.  Edit: It is a 9 rate, great game, very different strategies and variability of gameplays, a lot of interaction, after a couple more games I can say it works fine in 2, 3 or 4, probably one of the best games of this year.

912877,alepsycho,7.5,"I enjoyed this game a lot, it is a simple and efficient filler. The key here is that the auction forces the first player to make a good bid every round and this is almost impossible to handle all the auction taking the best properties, so you have to be optimous with your money, sometimes it implies on taking bad properties. But this doesn't signify that you are going to make bad money of it, if you play it well you can make your small properties worth a lot of money and if you play bad in the second part of the game, you can make big properties don't pay to well. Interesting game, easy mechanics and fast playtime.",172,For Sale

I know that the same can be said of Go and Bridge, and some other games, but all that attention wasn't lavished for no reason.  The only problem with the game is that it induces madness, obsession, psychotic competitiveness and sadism in so many.  Still the most satisfying game I've ever played, though not always the most fun.",171,Chess

Not a 10 only because I think of 10s as final decisions, and you can't reach a final decision on something astonishing like this without a lot of play, or maybe even until it's done.  Maybe we'll become hungry for something different after repeated play, maybe this one sticks to your bones just as is, or maybe it keeps a steady diet of new tactical challenges coming your way.  At present it looks about as nourishing a game as you could hope for.  Update: it's a clear ten for me now.  A great achievement.",174430,Gloomhaven

472557,alethic,9,"Much more enjoyable than I was expecting: a really well thought out reworking of Arkham Horror.  Between them the two games do a decent job of covering five of my favourite 'Cthulhu' stories. AH invokes the last half of 'The Shadow over Innsmouth' and the back end of 'The Dunwich Horror': stories where some kind of New England eruption is underway.  EH invokes 'The Call of Cthulhu', 'At the Mountains of Madness', and maybe the back end of 'The Shadow Out of Time': investigation stories that piece stuff together from different places. Neither of them gets across the claustrophobic feel of 'The Whisperer in Darkness', 'The Haunter of the Dark', or 'The Case of Charles Dexter Ward'.  Both games have some out of place elements: shopping trips, Christian tropes, etc.  Those tend to pull me up more in AH, but EH isn't without them.  The link to those two great stories is certainly a reason to enjoy AH: I do prefer EH, however, for its rules, design, mechanics (double sided cards are a great rip from MoM), the strategy/ride balance, the global scope and the distinctive twist each AO brings to it. I had a lot of fun with AH, and now do the same with EH.

18987,Alex Brown,10,By far the best auction game I have played. Much more streamlined and fun than the lauded Knizia titles.   Changes significantly depending on player count. I prefer the 4er and 5er games where you aren't sure of the property counts. ,172,For Sale
56155,Alex Brown,10,"Why I think you should play this:  *Mage Knight has a pedestrian theme. However, the generic narrative leaves a lot open-ended, and this assists in allowing you to build different characters different ways every time. Mage Knight is not an adventure game; it's a deck-building game with a fantasy theme.   *This game has been called fiddly, but it shouldn't be compared to Euros. Instead, this is Magic Realm playable in an evening. When you read it in that vein, you see the economy of components and how enormous breadth has been contained in a pleasant and functional tactile experience.  *The gameplay is absorbing. [thread=864817]Beginner strategy here[/thread] and [thread=864916]Expert strategy here[/thread].  *Patrick Carroll makes a good distinction between 'god' and 'hero' games and in Mage Knight I think you are seeing the perfect blend. You are building your hero with personal customizations, but you are also above the game, manipulating it, not falling prey to the whims of chance. The world is randomly constructed but you control what you do in it. Definitely not an adventure game!  Why I might not recommend this:  *I play it exclusively as a solo experience and as a solo game this is definitively the best. I can see playing co-operatively with experienced players, but cannot see how this succeeds as a multiplayer game. The downtime issues are tremendous, and the options for conflict between players badly written up. I think for the time this takes to play, there are many, many better multiplayer conflict games. ",96848,Mage Knight Board Game
115460,Alex Brown,10,"Now that this game has been cemented as one of my few 10s, I'm adding some high-modality commentary!  As a solo game, or a 'science', Chess is unparallelled. Your goals can be diverse, but are always achievable. No matter your level, you can always be better. Unlike other games, the horizon can be grasped. If you are 2700+ then you're playing for a living, anyway, so it's not a game anymore for you!  A lot has been said about how you must know this opening, or that, and while I would dispute the notion that knowing a game well is a hindrance to its play, at the same time, the 'sport' in Chess comes from identifying positions that you think will make your opponent psychologically uncomfortable. For instance, I play 1. d4 exculsively, so a King's side player who prefers sharp, tactical play is at an advantage if she can bend the position to those preferences. This struggle might only be apparent to experienced players, but most games require a level of experience to appreciate.   I adore several variants of Chess. While I prefer 5-10 minute games in real life, I also love Bughouse Chess - the game that provided me with some of the most joyous experiences as a teenager discovering gaming during high school. I find the 'art' of Chess accessible under time pressure, where moves find themselves and profundity happens!  Comparisons with GO and other lifestyle abstracts: I appreciate the GO is more 'intuitive' but I have been heartened to see my instincts confirmed by the recent news computers beat GO players now, as they do Chess players. Technophobia aside, I prefer Chess because of the aesthetic - the different functions of the pieces provide different themes to games, whereas GO relies strongly on the player to create the narrative. With the wealth of culture behind these two games, I don't think any other game rivals. In the end, my preferences lie with a fascination for Soviet and European history and culture over Asian culture, even if overall both intrigue me.     ",171,Chess
754345,Alex Brown,8,,103885,Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game
826438,Alex Brown,9,"A behemoth. All gamers should move past the generic setting, iconography issues, and point-salad style win conditions to appreciate an even purer distillation of the good, but unreplayable, Puerto Rico. Experienced players should really be jumping in with the first two expansiosn (TGS and RvI) at least, probably also considering AA as a starting point as well. My general thesis is that all Euros are the same, so you should only own one. If so, this is it!  RFTG effectively boils down the 'space opera' experience into a < 60 mins experience. There's diplomacy (role selection), military and industry (production). There's exploration, expansion (develop/settle), exploitation (trade/consume) and even extermination if you want it (takeovers).   The theme is immersive if you let it be. The art is original, slick and consistent. The backdrop gives intrigue to the development of personal fiefdoms without being overpowering. I actively enjoy linking my empire of random cards with a backstory. It's there.   The player dynamics are subtle, but also ingenious. The role selection mechanism allows players to gain from guessing opponent actions, but doesn't impede players from doing what they want without engaging in mindgames.   This is a quiet game of min-maxing, and I think it's relatively quick-playing time, combined with its depth of possibilities, has made me uninterested in exploring space operas or economic games in general. I've played thousands of times, and still very much enjoy it.   The expansions add a lot to this game, and my sweet spot is somewhere between the first and second expansions (though all are good in different ways). While the cards aren't imbalanced, the expansions each prioritise different things, and sometimes it can be hard to find players who see eye-to eye on what sort of experience they want from this game. I find the 2-player game much, much different from the multiplayer.   In the end, my sons are young and the groups I used to play with this are long gone. One day, I could see this re-ascending into the Imperius slot, but while I have the digital app to burn a few hundred games each time an expansion is released, the complexity is still a bit beyond my very local game groups. Until then, after what I would estimate could be several thousands of games, play me at your peril :). ",28143,Race for the Galaxy

685344,AlexanderVanhulsel,8.25,"Descent is one of the best miniature games I have ever played, where a group of players band up against the Overlord player which controls some cool creatures like dragons etc. The theme is great, the miniatures are AWESOME and the fact that you have different scenarios, different skills to choose from, different items, different characters, different Overlord cards etc. offers you a great deal of variety. Your characters do not have a lot of health, and a decent hit could consume half of your hit points in an instance. This creates tension, you never know you will live to see the next turn (well technically, you don't die but are just knocked down). However, this brings along that combat can feel really swingy at times, and also too luck-based. One turn you are winning without question, the other you feel like crying and giving up. Although I like games where there is some mechanism to deal with a runaway leader problem, I think they overdid it with this one. Another problem is the set-up, which can take a long time. The disadvantages do not outweigh the advantages, but I can imagine people put off be this. Still a wonderful game!

There's a lot of strategy, and while there isn't as much chance for sabotage, the fact that you're playing semi-solitaire lets you better use the cards for your own doing. It's a very ""in your own head"" kind of game, but it's tons of fun, and really gets your brain whirring. Definitely a favourite, and it never overstays its welcome as it plays quickly.

Fortunately, the game itself is good enough to make us interested in an epic 2-race battle on the 4p board.  After a few more games, the variety seems to diminish, though -- and it becomes a bit more of a calculational Euro with fancy clothes.

I love how much variety there is in the cards and theyre abilities, and how this wide variety of abilities is neatly expressed on the cards with simple and intuitive symbols.  I love the variety in the large scoring 'buildings', and how they do something cool as well, so its ok to build them earlier.

'Luck' occurs in the form of player chaos / player role selections which could hurt or help you. The game doesnt even take the 90 mins stated on the box, once players become familiar with it, it takes about 45-75 mis, depending on #players.

Balances initial cylons vs those who receive the Cylon card in sleeper agents. Balances the character cards greatly, makes some of them much more interesitng, and adds new and interesting characters as well. Balances the skill cards some, reducing the importance of this (broken?)

I really like how adventuring rewards a small family size by forcing you to play your higher level character last.  If you want to be able to play it before other players adventurers, you need to have less people than them.  This gives a few reasons why you wouldnt just go all in on family growth.

970639,AlexFS,8.5,"[i]2016/12/27 3 plays 3-4p[/i]  (copy-pasted from Scythe comment)  To me Scythe feels like an evolution from Eclipse. Same hexagonal play area (but not modular), same central galactic core (factory), asymmetric powers, space ships (mechas).  Scythe lacks an exploration phase, and the opportunity for players to build their galaxy by choosing how to place system tiles.  Also, there is no mecha customization, whereas spaceship design is a strong suit of Eclipse.  In Scythe combat is much more streamlined, which is really a plus, but it's much less epic than with Eclipse.  Scythe offers more modularity in the asymmetric powers by randomly combining two player faction boards, whereas Eclipse has fixed boards (but more of them with the expansions).  Artwork in Scythe completely crushes Eclipse. Scythe art is beautiful and distinct, Eclipse artwork is generic and uninspired.  Eclipse plays nine turns, Scythe endgame is activated by achieving 6 ""goals"", which is a mechanic I disliked.  I had the feeling that Scythe played faster than Eclipse.  Scythe has a popularity mechanic, whereas Eclipse only has a puny ""traitor"" negative tile.  Scythe has a seemingly great solo module, but as I don't own neither Eclipse, nor Scythe, that is irrelevant to me.  Given the choice, I'll play Eclipse any time over Scythe. The tension, epic scale, diversity of strategies are much grander in Eclipse than Scythe.  Please, design Eclipse with better artwork, and fix the combat mechanic.",72125,Eclipse

This has amazing table talk though, hence its high rating and request rate.",10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill

38445,Alexlimol,10,"Man, what a great game. Unfortunately I haven't played as much as I would like it. It is the kind of game that when it is over I find myself thinking that it would be great if it had lasted a couple more rounds/turns, perhaps adding a couple more rubis to the end goal would be a nice ""house rule"" to solve it, but as I mentioned above I haven't played enough to fell confident about messing with the rules. Great component quality, even in the brazilian version that is produced by a mass market company (something like Hasbro I believe), a lot of variability due to the, almost, free arrangement of the places tiles. I like it a lot , but the rest of the folks in my house weren't as excited, perhaps an average 8 amongst the 4 of us.",148949,Istanbul
90974,Alexlimol,10,"Fantastic game, it gets playd a lot around here (our house;) and it is an unanimity. It has tough decisions and plenty of variability.

101270,Alexlimol,10,"A game that enchants and mesmerizes everybody. the cards art is absolutely gorgeous and the mechanism, or the game dynamics, is incredibly involving, you just don't believe it will work when you first hear the rules explanation, then the game starts and you are hooked.I strogly recommend you buy the base game with one or two expansions because during the first few times you play it is likely you will play several times in a row and feel the need for different cards, perhaps this is the only (minor) problem of the game, if you play it with the same group people will start repeating the ""definitions"".",39856,Dixit

How about the components quality? Man, Days of Wonder awesomeness in a box.",157354,Five Tribes

After watching many videos and enduring it happened, and it was amazing. I’m totally hooked, and now that I understand the game it is actually very easy to teach and intuitive for new players, you just need one person who ‘gets it’ to handle the phase ordering, timing and card interactions.

Arkham Horror TCG is by far the best among them. This is a choose-your-own-adventure game, in many ways.  Arkham Horror TCG is an interactive story, like the two other games. However, the campaign mode, altering your deck after scenarios, and new settings in successive scenarios provide a very different feel to the game than the other two games.   Unfortunately, to get the most out of this game, you would have to buy everything available for it, and that costs at least $500. Fantasy Flight design their games with expandability in mind and every little expansion is moderately expensive.   Arkham Horror and Eldritch Horror don’t give the investigators much substance, nor much that is unique about them.

Makes you think on the spot and feels like an experience when left with limited choices on what to do. I love atmospheric games where I can immerse myself into. I could do with a longer play time but I assume most people love the 1 1/2 to 2 hour game of a scenario.  Fantastic game!  The rulebook is fine as it is.

This game makes you think a lot, 1 wrong move may led to losing many prestige points in the game.  It is also important to take note of the order on the activation of buildings, as it is always forgotten by players.  Good points: Many dimensions to the game, you need money to place the workers, resources to build buildings as well as the castle.  Royal favours can be really useful in the game too.  Provost is a good way to slow down a player's progress  Bad points: Nothing bad I can really pinpoint about except that it can really be brain draining.  After thought: A game that is really fun if you are a serious gamer, however i doubt that it will appeal to casual gamers.  My favourite game to this point of time and I would really recommend to all serious gamers.",18602,Caylus
931422,alexus_kazuk,7.6,"In Shadows over Camelot, players becomes subjects of King Arthur who tries to win enough quests to win the game.  Each character has their special abilities and players have to collaborate to win the game.  In the game, there are many quests which the heroes are able to take part in.  Some quests are continuous quests which after the completion of the quest will restart the quest all over again.  Some quests are 1 time quests which the quest will usually be awarded with some artifacts which will help players in the game.  Though most players are your friends in the game, 1 of the players may be the traitor in the game who is out to sabotage other players.  Players can call accused each other as the traitor but penalty would be given if accusations were made to the wrong person.  Win enough quests to win the whole game which the traitor will really try hard to prevent it.  Good points: An interesting game which players collaborate to win the game together.  There are many quests in the game, which players are able to select the most appropriate quest (depending on the hands of the player) to complete.  Flipping over the dark cards (one of the bad actions) can be exciting towards the later part of the game when players prayed hard not to encounter certain cards.  Bad points: It is really hard to win this game.  After playing for quite a lot of times, we can only win the game once.  My friends and I kept playing the game while we lost, but after we won the game once, we are so tired that we never played the game anymore.  Shadows over Camelot is a game similar to Pandemic which players collaborate to acheive the winning objective of the game with a slight difference.  It is similar because players have to do a bad action then followed by a good action.  The bad action will prevent players from winning, but the good action will help players win the game.  The difference being that there may be a traitor amongst all the heroes.  It adds uncertainty to the game and follows more or less the storyline of King Arthur which makes the game more interesting.",15062,Shadows over Camelot

16578,ALGO,10,"Motto: The rules are not the game  A strange game indeed, as a simple numerical superiority game (ships + card values) gets turned into a melting pot of powers, backstabbing and leader bashing by the addition of no less than 50 available aliens whose powers break the rules in fundamental ways.  The best thing is seeing how they interact (Virus vs Antimatter, anyone?) and the feeling of bluffing your opponents into helping you to a victory.  I can't see myself ever getting bored of it.  12/2017  I was right - I have never got bored. We play every Lobstercon and while my copy has not even been open for years, the love has not died away. I still miss playing without flares occasionally as sometimes the ""bullshit"" level increases over my tolerance threshold.",39463,Cosmic Encounter

500879,ALGO,9,"Praise the gaming gods for an original theme and a short playing time. I like engine builders and the fact that your available actions drop every round.  However - I rarely buy something on hype alone and usually get stung when I do. We shall see if there is really something here.  Edit: Have now played 8x 2 player games against three different opponents and this game is an absolute cracker. Once both players know how to play it's done and dusted in under 40 minutes.   Initial concerns about eggs being the whole of round 4 dispelled after realising that that's only the case if you don't set up any big moves during round 3 (e.g. I played a bird for points AND it played eggs on all the birds with the same nest).  The game does have one issue, but I don't think it's a big deal - there are definitely ways you can get screwed on drawn cards if you're unlucky. I think the spending of cards for food mitigates this and also the swap birds (tuck and draw) help too.   There is a possibility that you don't get a mitigation route for a lack of brown cards and the whole game is a bit of a one sider - at the length of a play of Wingspan I just don't think this is a big deal, certainly with 2 people.",266192,Wingspan
539075,ALGO,8,"It's fun, but not a patch on the sequel - collecting the cards is far too arbitrary so it all feels less like exploring than just avoiding death until random chance hands you some stuff.",65244,Forbidden Island
599535,ALGO,8,"The concept of searching for lost cities is totally irrelevant however, since this is really an abstract suit building game of scoring high against a high initial risk. Again, it is waaaay better than it sounds, and has a great mechanic whereby if you discard a card you don't need. your opponent can nick it - meaning you have to be careful what you get rid of as well as what you put down.",50,Lost Cities

730607,ALGO,8,"Vlaada Chvatil may well be my favourite designer. What impresses me is his range.  On one end of the scale we have the manic, frantic space ship building shenanigans on offer here - in stark contrast to the very brain intensive Through The Ages it is possible to have a great time here on your very first go.  Once you have built a spaceship from ill-fitting, ill-suited components, it flies across the galaxy (well, a bunch of cards are drawn - use your imagination!) and gets smashed to bits.  Or not.  It depends how well you built your ship.  Unless you were really unlucky.  It also has one of the funniest rulebooks ever, but does require a bit of front loading of rules (the components are varied and wonderful) but it's more than worth it.  A fabulous game.",31481,Galaxy Trucker
941718,ALGO,8,"Another modern classic, a game where you place one of four different coloured tiles or a monument every turn and score points for each. You have four leader matching those colours and you only gain points if a route can be traced to those leaders. If two leaders of the same colour fight it out players can add tile from their hadn to assist the fight. Only one can gain control of a set of tiles. Its quite hard to explain here, and equally hard to teach, but again - your patience is well rewarded by this game.  Trade Info: I have played this copy once. It is the old edition with one sided board and none of the modular expansions. It's a great game, but my copy will never get played and everyone I would play it with owns their own copy.",42,Tigris & Euphrates
974289,ALGO,8,"It was the hotness for a while but seems to have suffered a backlash from people expecting more than it ever offered.  A reasonably quick abstract territorial advantage game where you get to basically give up on your civilisation at least once and strike out with a new one.  There's a lot of potential combinations, some with great power, but this tends to be offset by the group pounding you'll get.  I'm quite keen on this, especially given the fact it scales for a wide range of numbers of players - with different boards for each.",40692,Small World

678658,alicenchainz,10,"A great co-op dungeon crawler with a fantastic combat system and epic campaign, Gloomhaven offers an in depth experience that makes you want to keep coming back and play.   With a co-op style that balances selfish acts and teamwork you will find yourself working with and sometimes against your friends as your progress through the scenarios and fight the bad guys. The  combat system also embodies the selfish and teamwork aspect forcing you to make hard decisions about what cards to use and when to use them.  The leveling and customization in Gloomhaven is full of options but forces you to make hard decisions about how you want to progress. This variety allows for you to be creative in how you craft your characters abilities and strengths. The designers have done a fantastic job of fine tuning the balance such that it never feels like you are overpowered but it also doesn't feel like your underpowered.   The campaign is over 90 scenarios that you will unlock as you move through the game. Each offers unique challenges and can be set at a difficulty that works best for you and your friends. You will also at times face having to choose between two diverging paths that might close off some scenarios, making your decisions more impactful and leading to some hot debate with your friends about what direction you want to go in.  The game does require a good amount of patience as the rule book is not so well laid out. There are a myriad of small details that can have a large impact on combat and the game in general that missing them can have a negative effect on your gaming experience. I highly recommend watching instruction videos and taking your time when playing the first scenario so as to not miss out on all the important rules.  The set up time is also very long, making the overall game time longer than the 30-120 minutes. The box the game comes in is very sparse on organization so it is up to you on how you want to organize it. For cheep sake, I recommend sandwich bags or card slot holders as your do NOT want to just through the game into the box.  Gloomhaven is the first boardgame for me that has brought back the same level of excitement and adventure that I felt when I first started playing World of Warcraft. Exploring the world without knowing the outcome, spending countless hours connecting with my character and facing the frustration and gratification of epic combat makes Gloomhavenand epic addition to any boardgamers collection. I highly recommend it.",174430,Gloomhaven

It is playful and has a nice re-playability. The materials are beautiful. At home, where heavier games clearly have their place, Wingspan works for what it is. A light game but with this little something that makes it easy to hesitate to release it in parallel with a more complex game without considering its setting. The interaction between players is clearly not the foundation of this game, which is why I prefer the 2-player game because we take more time to watch what the other is doing. The defect compared to a game with 3 or 4 concerns the renewal of available resources (especially at the beginning of the game). Love ",266192,Wingspan

249171,alita_4b,9,"The rules are simple, and the game play is fast and dynamic. There are race and special ability combos that you purchase with victory points - you run these rampant across the map. The moment that you anticipate that your troops will be less useful, you put the civilization in decline and pick up a new race-ability pair. You can only have one race in decline at once, except if you have the OP ability called Spirit that lets you have 2. The production value is high on this Days of Wonder game with icons on race and ability tokens that tell you what they do, an extremely well down player aid, and different maps depending on number of players. Fantastic with 5 players that clocks in around the 1-1.5 hour mark.   In one of our 5 player games, two people ended up being fairly shut out due to the poor combos that were available to them. In addition, the Cursed ability caused a bottleneck as the top combo after everyone had selected their initial one, so players were very reluctant to go into decline.   UPDATE: Some of the races and abilities are stronger than others. The Sorcerers and Trolls are strong races. Fortified and Spirit are strong abilities. The expansions add variety and interest.   Tracked on family list (grooven)!",40692,Small World

343550,alita_4b,8,"Alhambra is one of my favorite games yet! The rules are easy to learn and it's intuitive to play.   However, the point scoring for ties is overly complicated. During the first scoring round, each type of building is scored for the player with the most buildings (of that type). During the scoring round, if there is a tie, then the points are divided among contesting players (rounded down, if necessary).   The rules are not clear on how to score points if 2 players tie for first place and there are points available for a 2nd or 3rd place finishing. Here's how it's supposed to be handled, according to BGG: http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/88797 and http://www.boardgamegeek.com/thread/32222. I'd prefer that tie scoring is handled like El Grande - if 2 players are tied for first, then the points are split, and then the next placed player gets the points for third place (if applicable).

705466,alita_4b,9,"The perennial game - a classic. My game group played countless games over the years, before we even heard of BGG. We've had marathon gaming nights lasting until dawn. We even keep a game log (complete with questions/answers to complex game situations and a list of winners).  Even though SoC is a dice game with a med-high luck factor, my group believes that you can effectively strategize and change tactics depending on what's rolled and what resources people have. Why build a settlement on the 8 or 9 when the 10 or 11 is hot? What do you do when 3 is rolled 3 times in a row and the 6 hasn't been rolled all game? Where's the best place to put the robber, on a hot number or a more likely number?   The player interaction level is fairly high too. Screw someone too early in the game, you have an enemy working against you. If you take the lead too early, you're a marked player. We love to talk during trades too (look, my sheep is better!). And perish the thought of trading someone with 7+ points, you'll be heckled for the rest of the game. Oh look, so-and-so has all those development cards, must be victory points, they are in the lead! Hours of fun!  I rate plain SoC higher than the expansions because it's fast-paced and easy, and we can get in multiple games in a night. Also, SoC games are typically close games where everyone has an active role. Even if it's a blowout, it's usually quick and painless.   Played SoC dozens of times before I started tracking my games played (approx. 50-100 games).  UPDATE: Finally played this again after a long hiatus. We started with the sample board and starting positions to even out the board for the 2 new players. Turned out, the sample board was awful - poor settlement and road placements that didn't make sense (for example, some second round choices settlement and road placements would have been better in other places).   New version: Flimsy board pieces, ports are permanently set on border pieces, but they don't sit well to frame the hexagonal board.   Tracked on family list (grooven)!",13,Catan
773716,alita_4b,7,2015 UPDATE: Video reviews reminded me that I did like this game. Gonna keep it and consider getting the 9000 expansion.,122522,Smash Up
875136,alita_4b,8,"Played a 2 player game. Very fast and fun! I'm having trouble seeing how this would work with 4 or 6 players - like my sister pointed out, you could get eliminated fairly easily if the King(s) or outsiders aim for all attack dice. UPDATE: Tried with 6 players - had a blast, quick, fun, fast, great little longer filler. 2015 UPDATE: Almost gets better with time as this has become a favorite of our gaming group when we are short on time from our epic, long games.",70323,King of Tokyo

The rulebook is terrible which I don't know how they managed to pull off since it is so short. (typos and just hard to understand imo).   2. The back of the rulebook has pictures of how many of each type of tiles there are in the dominos. Knowing these ratios are critical to good play. I think they should have included cards for each player with the same information, otherwise one has to prop the flimsy rulebook up.  Nonetheless fantastic game.",204583,Kingdomino

607340,alkaiser,9,Excellent game with lots of tough choices throughout. I like the resource management aspect of the game and how it meshes nicely with the plant auctions as well as with plant building (the cheaper your resources the more money you have to build). There can be some luck of the draw issues with the power plant draws but that just means that you can't expect that each game will progress the same as the last so you have to maintain some flexibility in your strategy.

The fantasy theme is enthralling; the mechanics are fluid and ever-changing; the skill, strategy and challenge involved in building decks remains one of my most favourite aspects of the game. Not to mention the card art is, very often, outstanding.

203557,alluvian,9.5,"I think this is a 9.5 because I am always desperate to play it. I find it fairly hard to get to the table, but enjoy it a lot every time.  Great game with 3-4 players!  Two negatives: 1) this can get super thinky for some people and they might take forever on their turn.  Those people MAY be mostly me. 2) I feel it is a bad 2 player game.  The two player rules create MANY scenarios where you go twice in a row.  That is not only super powerful, but also exponentially increases the difficulty of optimizing the first of those two moves. It also makes the bidding much harder to calculate.  When bidding who wins the game often hinges on who can calculate the value of taking two turns in a row on the current board state.  That is a VERY hard mental calculation to do well on.",157354,Five Tribes
491612,alluvian,8.5,"The game is drop dead gorgeous.  For a game where the mechanics are based on the visuals, this is super important.  The game is really fun as both the ghost and the investigators.  If the ghost is not having fun, I am pretty sure the game would not work at all. This has not happened in any of our plays though.  I would never assign a ghost regularly and make sure it is the role the player wants to play.",181304,Mysterium
552478,alluvian,9,"Very fun game, but since I usually play this at big gatherings and 6 players, rules explanation can take 30 - 60 mins alone and the game will go on for most of an afternoon.  I am okay with that, as the game feels like it has enough heft and enough arc to support that.  New players (and even people who have not played it recently) may be overwhelmed by the number of unique buildings.  There is a 'simple' version of the game that has many less buildings, but that version feel TOO simple.  I have not yet tried a setup where I take the simple game and then add a random X tiles from the 'advanced' ones.  I tend to find that the person sitting with the best view of the building tiles in a 6 player game will win, as others don't want to slow the game down by constantly walking around the table to see it well.  Sane humans would probably do best playing this a 4 or less players, heh.  It scales well for mechanics, but downtime becomes a serious issue.",102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers
623833,alluvian,8.5,"Still liking this game a lot.  I am waiting for my normal deck building rage to set in every time I play this, but it has not happened yet.  Usually I find deckbuilders frustrating due to the amount of luck that comes into whether you pull out the combos in one hand enough times in the course of the game.  I am usually CURSED in those games and if it has any take that or engine destruction I get salty fast.  Clank feels like a very different animal, with much of the engine building replaced by the push your luck mechanic.  [Update] Originally this game was a 9, but Clank! In! Space! made me drop it a little.  Some minor annoyances in the game that I didn't even realize were a problem were so nicely fixed with the In Space version that I am much more likely to pull that one out.  I hear there is still a big box expansion to Clank! coming in 2018 and I suspect many of the nice improvements to the system will be put in here.  Still an amazing game, and if I am teaching people who have not played a deck builder before, or if they are in general fairly new to boardgaming, I will pull out Clank (with the expansion).  Once they play a game of that I will see if they like the space theme as well and then move on to that.  I would not be at all unhappy playing this original still though.",201808,Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure
868360,alluvian,8,"If this game had better colorblind friendlyness I would MAYBE give this a 9.  Very fun game, I think one of the optional rules in the expansion rules should be a rule in the main game.  We houserule this in.  Just give an extra victory point for every set of three types of victory cards you have.  This promotes diversity, and alleviates a concern I have that the gardener cards are a bit too strong and swingy if you pull one that is almost complete or already done.",70919,Takenoko
954835,alluvian,8.5,"Probably my most played game in my collection. So easy to pull out and surprisingly deep.  I entirely do NOT understand complaints of multiplayer solitaire on this game. All player states are completely visible and very easy to parse at a glance.  You can guess opponent strategy fairly seamlessly and move in to block by reserving something they want or see they will beat you to a card and move toward another one.  The only negative on this game is that giving away your strategies can be so damaging to your play that we find ourselves closely guarding our plans, making this a fairly quiet game of people staring at the table and quietly making their moves.  This type of behavior is NOT multiplayer solitaire, quite the reverse, but I can see that this is not what some are looking for in a game.",148228,Splendor
1031853,alluvian,7,"Keeping track of the point totals at each location can be a bit of a pain for such a quick and simple game on the surface. Cards that change power depending on whose turn it is, all the counters, cards that act as multipliers, etc..  I would give this maybe a 6 if I had to do all the accounting. Luckily I can usually offload at least some of that to the other players.",122522,Smash Up

The mechanics are simple, there is a bit of luck involved, its got a backstabbing setup that adds fun, but it has become a bit of a cash cow.

The light elements of bluffing and deduction are fun, the portability is great, and due to how fast the game plays (another plus), the higher level of randomness doesn't feel punishing. Sure, you can get eliminated in turn one if you're unlucky, but a round probably won't last longer than a couple minutes. And it's often pretty funny how you lose.

The cooperative nature, fun puzzling aspect of coordinating each other's moves, easy to like theme with broad appeal (not too nerdy, but not boring), and ease of learning contribute to it being a big hit. We never play just one game. Even without expansions, it hasn't started feeling repetitive. I've managed to get people who don't care much for board games interested in playing this one.  Months on: I love ramping up the difficulty in this game.  It is regularly brought to holiday gatherings and replays are often requested. I still do not have the expansion, and it's still my favorite.",30549,Pandemic

53221,alpas,10,"Давно хотел написать отзыв, но, видимо, так и не соберусь уже.   После десятой партии (спустя полгода плотного увлечения настольными играми) жена сказала, что из всех коробок в наших шкафах ""Ханаби"" - самая правильная, представляющая из себя ровно то, что она ждала от настольных игр в принципе: общение и взаимодействие. Полное ощущение, что ты посредством карт играешь именно с другим человеком, а не пользуешься человеком как каким-то квази-AI, чтобы сыграть в игру (неважно, с кем). При игре на двоих ты будто бы завязываешь себе глаза, доверяешь свою судьбу напарнику, а он берёт тебя за руку и осторожно ведёт через минное поле. Ни с чем не сравнимые впечатления.  Ещё один интересный эффект не затронут в обзоре. Периодически в ходе игры возникает мощная иллюзия того, что ты всё идеально просчитал, и у твоего напарника есть только один-единственный верный ход (на который ты ему и намекаешь своей меткой подсказкой). На самом же деле, конечно, твой мозг отфильтровал часть информации, о другой части не догадывается, а у напарника, глядящего в твои карты, может быть вообще иное видение ситуации. В такие моменты очень легко могут возникнуть разочарования и конфликты, особенно если каждый из вас совершенно уверен в своих аналитических способностях. Видел, как на реддите игру называют divorce fireworks ;)  В общем, ""Ханаби"" - обоюдоострый скальпель, которым, при осторожном обращении можно добраться до самой души человеческих отношений.    Ниже старые заметки. поначалу сложно запоминать, что у тебя в руке (особенно, если напарник долго думает над ходом), карты в руке от напряжения гнутся, лучше иметь какую-то подставочку под них.   Лида в итоге взяла блокнот с карандашом, записывать известные данные :) я вроде справился и так, но пару раз забывал, что мне говорили. игра довольно весёлая, будем пробовать ещё.   в комплекте сразу идёт дополение, которое добавляет радужный фейерверк, у которого все карты в одном экземпляре.  на BGG не указано, что есть русская версия (Lifestyle Boardgames Ltd). карты гнутся, края крошатся. очень хочется перейти на делюксовую версию. возможно, купим (и покрасим ;) набор домино.  долго дискутировали с Лидой, можно ли строить стратегию на порядке называния карт. в правилах этого нет, Лида считает такой подход нечестным.  BGG: твоя задача как умелого игрока в ""Ханаби"" - научиться действовать максимально предсказуемо во всевозможных ситуациях.  reddit: чувак на реддите идёт с девушкой на игротеку на первое свидание (она уже ходила туда сама), просит посоветовать подходящую игру. некоторые упоминают ""Ханаби"". другие комментируют: By Hanabi, do you mean divorce fireworks? %) https://www.reddit.com/r/boardgames/comments/3bqwlh/first_date_tonight_in_a_board_game_cafe/csp175d  в комплекте идёт мини-дополнение с шестым, радужным фейерверком (в локализации каждая карта только в одном экземпляре, что сужает число вариантов игры с этим дополнением). Лида шутит, что наш брак ещё недостаточно крепок для игры с ним ;)",98778,Hanabi

985754,alphaamigo,8.1,"This is a cool little game.  It's so easy to learn and play.  Every time I play, I want to try a different strategy.  The only draw back is how overly-balanced the game is, which might be a plus for many people. There is no way at all to get to an early lead.  Even if you do something really smart and get the right piece for the right price at the right time, you will still be opening up your opponent to gain something as well.  In fact, it kind of feels like one player could do almost nothing and it would still be a close game,  The counterbalance to this is how you construct your quilt board.  The one thing that matters more than anything else is fitting the fabric pieces well on your board.  This also means that very often it will be the person who gets the 7 bonus points for making a 7x7 grid who wins, but not necessarily.  Making a 7x7 grid costs you the opportunity to use larger pieces at the end of the game which are needed to cover large areas on your board.  Anyway, the games are ALWAYS close.  It doesn't matter how much ""better"" or ""worse"" you play, the game is going to be close.  There are too many balances in the scoring for one person to just slaughter another.  Nevertheless, this is a very fun very replayable game that can be found for a reasonable price.",163412,Patchwork

41782,Alpure,10,"First impression: 10/10 Current impression: 10/10  The first time I played it with my friends almost 2 years ago. Then in another year I played it in another company. Recently I've recalled playing it and actually enjoying it, so I decided to get it. It's not that expensive and it's portable, which is great.  I've had it for a week now approximately, and I'm totally enjoying it and I'm kind of addicted.   - Short review of the game:  In my opinion, it's a game for 2 players. Maybe 3... 4 in the outermost case.  Because: the more players there are, the more luck-based the game becomes. And the longer it lasts.   I highly recommend playing with people who know the rules already and played the game before. And it's also better to make time limits for each turn, playing online we have a 55 sec limit to do all actions (picking roles first, and then in the next phase using the role, collecting money, drawing cards, building, also has to be done in 55 seconds). That can be a bit problematic online if there is lag, but if you play the game normally at a table - it shouldn't be a problem.  In a game with more than 4 people it becomes chaotic and luck-based, as I've already stated. It will just depend on the person's hand and on the randomness of assassins and thieves. There are only 3 destructive roles out of the 8: Assassin, Thief, Warlord.  Warlord can only destroy a building of one person/turn. It might be alright for trolling, but in a game with many players - that doesn't give anything. And Assassins and Thieves mainly just hit random players. These roles are chosen by the advanced players to not be assassinated or picked themselves with a 100% chance, and to start first. In my second game, when we were 5 I think... One person just was getting assassinated and picked over and over. Every turn. ""F* this game..."", ""I hate this game"" he said. And that was not logical. It was random. He even chose the least advantageous roles to avoid being killed.    Didn't work. Of course that way some people will hate this game. :)   For 2 players it's totally strategical thinking, psychology too I would say. 2 players is really a challenge. Assassins and Warlords can really do damage here. In the beginning if you have bad building cards, you can choose the Magician, use the best of them, and give the other trash to the player. That might ruin his game. King is a bold role, because next turn you're choosing first. Merchant is overpowered, but for this very reason he is targeted the most. The bishop isn't too strong as far as I can judge by my few games, but still has his pros.  2 Roles per turn mechanics is great in my opinion. That's best for 2-3 Players. Enjoy! ",478,Citadels

Once you're rocking these variants it's a really great game. The next obstacle is finding people willing to play with you (it's a thinking game and can be a little daunting at first) and finding the time to play.  Also, Fantasy Flight Games is a great company with superb customer service.",103343,A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)

357532,Alspacha,10,Our very first proper board game and what a game at that. We bought it as a couple and at first were a little overwhelmed by all the rules but we preserved and were certainly rewarded with a marvellous game. The co-operative nature of the game was intriguing as a new comer. It allowed us to navigate the rules together and develop strategy. The game allows for a lot of excitement as it is often quite tense and a wrong decision can lead to the end of the word! Would highly recommend as an introduction to the world of gaming but you will keeping coming back to it forever because it is such fun.,30549,Pandemic
380526,Alspacha,10,"Excellent game. Have only ever played 2 player but love it in this format. Started out playing the traditional rules but after getting a hang of the game we saw instructions online for a double world alternative for 2 players. Essentially this involves each player controlling two factions each and at the end of the game they add and then divide their faction scores, to receive their final score. This is a very satisfying mode of play because there is very little down time and you get to develop two different strategies which hopefully complement each other and lead to your victory!  Would recommend this game highly to semi-serious to serious board gamers, and especially recommend 2 player as a great experience.",120677,Terra Mystica

We must have respect here, all the card games designed, published since 1993 owe everything to this game.  It is a really well designed game, just one pack of revised edition had me hooked, I was blown away. I played an awful lot, played a couple of times at the UK nationals back in the 90's but eventually life caught up and Magic had to go. I loved the competitive side of the game but the time and money drain forced me out in the end.  I have dipped back into the game after a 20 year gap, but the mountain of expansions and variety of formats and financial investment required is not for me.  All that said it is an amazing game, slick gameplay, so thematic with almost endless scope for strategy. Of course certain specific deck types do dominate the tournament scene from time to time but this can be challenging and is all part of the MTG world.

275257,altonu,9.5,"Received from Secret Santa 2017.  Had been wanting this for quite a while, added it to my wish list when I heard it might be getting reprinted in time for Christmas.  Glad I did.  Lookin forward to getting this one to the table.  Played with 3 and 5 players so far. Enjoyed very much with both player counts. Each play has left me feeling like I learned a bit about another layer of strategy the game has to offer. Glad to be able to say it has lived up to my expectations. Looking forward to getting Salsa and some more maps, but still a great experience with just the base game.  Update ~1year later Having played this MANY times in the last year is has quickly become a favourite. On any given day it would be hard to choose a favourite among Concordia, viticulture and power grid for me.",124361,Concordia

Con 7-8 jugadores es perfecto, sencillo de explicar y muy rejugable. Gusta a todo el mundo al que le he enseñado, partidas con tensión y mucha emoción, por eso le doy un 8.5. Lo que no me gusta? No poder jugarlo entre 3 ó 4 en todo su esplendor.",478,Citadels
504668,AlvaroH,9,"Desde que conozco este mundillo siempre me llamó este juego, aunque nunca tuve claro que me fuera a gustar. El caso es que me ha parecido una obra maestra, juego sencillo, pero con muchísima profundidad, con algo de azar (controlable) y puteo, si es que lo quieres. Turnos rápidos, miles de opciones, bueno para 2,3 ó 4 jugadores, hora y media como mucho de duración...

Los jugadores han de colocar trabajadores en los diferentes edificios para contribuir a la construcción de un castillo. El juego es perfecto para 2-3 jugadores, a 4 ó 5 se descontrola bastante. Funciona muy bien, hay muchas estrategias a seguir, cero azar y bastante interacción entre los jugadores. Como nota negativa creo que en determinadas partidas al que se queda a la cola le cuesta mucho alcanzar al resto de los jugadores, es un juego que no perdona los fallos, pero jugado con gente que sepa jugarlo es una maravilla.Es un juego muy rápido de desplegar, que ocupa poco espacio en la mesa y que se disfruta desde el primer turno.

Jugado a 5 jugadores impecable, aunque con menos de 4 no tiene gracia. Uno de los juegos que más ganas tenía de probar y que ha cumplido con creces mis expectativas.

If you love horror or Lovecraft and medium complex games with dice, this is a no brainer.  6/1-11: Does not see enough table time due to long play time.

Easy to get others into play with about 10 to 15min of instructions, as long as one person really knows the rules.  Also own the Pegasus, Exodus and Daybreak expansions. Haven't used expansions yet.  This game creates great memories.   Playtime 3 hours.",37111,Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game

Everyone very willing to replay this game.  2 1/2 - 3 hr game?  Also included Merlin's Company, which doesn't add to the length, but provides a little more character.  ",15062,Shadows over Camelot
1018902,alvinsimms,8.1,Fun even as a two player game.  Best with 3 or 4. Don't play with more than 4 or it seems to drag on. Thematic flare keeps us coming back.  Succeeds where Arkham fell short.  I wouldn't recommend for new gamers unless they are big Lovecraft fans.  The reference rules are organized well and really help.  Hours of fun.  Pimped out with stands for Gates & Monsters and bought all the pre-painted figures from Fantasy Flight for the characters.  Also own the expansion: Mountains of Madness,146021,Eldritch Horror

Currently it is my highest rated game, not only because of the nostalgic place in my heart it holds, but also because of the intensely interactive and strategic game play it offers.  Each game feels fresh, new, and tense. I feel invested in the outcome of this game and that's always a good sign. Every time I play it I remember why I love it so much. Truly a great game.",93,El Grande
365024,alwaysjoshua,9,"Well, three plays into this one and I can see so much potential. I think it is mechanically easier than Agricola to understand, which I like; however, the options available in this game increase at a much faster rate than Agricola.  Unlike Agricola where you want more actions, Le Havre has you wishing for more turns. Sure the game is longer than Agricola, but by the end of it we always wanted to a few more rounds so that we could accomplish what we wanted to accomplish. Great theme and I can definitely see this game surpassing El Grande in my ""Always Want To Play It"" category. Bonus points for offering a ""short version"" for those times when the full game isn't possible.",35677,Le Havre

It's a beautifully designed game with very nice artwork. As a wildlife photographer, birdwatcher, and conservation biologist (specialised in birds), I thoroughly recommend this game for any bird enthusiasts. I don't know how else to put this than that it kind of gives me the feeling I get when a good book gets a good movie adaptation, and this is a very good adaptation of what birding feels like to me; pure excitement.",266192,Wingspan

373801,Alycat,10,Mage Knight is a fantastic deck builder / strategy game that is great fun both co-op and solo (I've never played the competitive mode as that doesn't really interest me).  The character development works really well and the pacing of the game is very nicely tuned.    It isn't perfect - the quality of the components isn't great and the rules take a bit of getting your head around but if you can look past this and slog your way through the initial tutorial it's more than worth it.  Any downsides are minor niggles and I can't give Mage Knight anything other than a 10 as I love this game so much.,96848,Mage Knight Board Game
543181,Alycat,9,"Excellent game, particularly if you can get enough people together who are able to pay attention to learning the relatively simple rules (this has proved surprisingly difficult in some of our games!)  Be warned though, this game can bring out a side of people that you didn't know existed. My husband is generally a pretty nice guy but as soon as the lid comes off the Resistance box he changes... Invariably he will stop at nothing to turn everyone against me and convince them that I'm the bad guy when it's *always* him!

The game really keeps you on your toes by gradually ramping up the complexity and bringing in a few twists here and there.  Difficulty is well-balanced - if you do well in one ""month"" then the next month is made slightly harder and vice versa.",161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1

If you already own Forbidden Island and get Forbidden Desert, be warned: you'll probably trade away Forbidden Island! Although I do kinda miss the rapidly shrinking island aspect....  Although it's not my favourite co-op (Space Alert), it's probably the best co-op I've played. What I mean by that is in most co-ops, each player is assigned his or her own duty, and they go off and do it. Not so in Forbidden Desert. In Desert, you MUST be working together very closely (and usually closely on the board) since each player is very much dependent on the others for survival. That in itself makes Forbidden Desert unique, and truly cooperative.

Now that the negative is totally out of the way, a MAJOR positive: in terms of player interaction, Bohnanza can't be beat!

822629,amacleod,7,"First, the negatives: a dumbed-down version of Settlers of Catan. Strategic thought is necessary, yes; but the strategies are pretty obvious (and by-the-by, playing with either one die or two can be game-winning: it all depends on the cards you've got). It's an engine-building game; but it is so stinkin' short that game-end leaves one feeling like, ""Wow...I was just getting started, and now it's over."" There is a definitely a runaway leader problem.  But in spite of all that, it's fun! Machi Koro is the perfect game to play with non-gamers.

As for Concordia being a deck-builder, it's far more of a deck-management game, and does that very well. Gone is Herr Gerdt's rondel, of which I am not at all a fan. Curiously, the playing of cards is remarkably similar to Lewis&Clark; yet in spite of that, the two games are utterly different!  It is a strategic game with a strong chaser of tactics, that keeps the players on their toes and ensures a great deal of replayability. There is an element of multi-player solitaire in Concordia, but really, that's only because no one can attack you directly. Your opponents are actually very annoying, although that it is due almost exclusively to the ""Hey! You took my spot/card!"" phenomenon.   Negatives? Only two, really. Since you can't really see what kind of multiplier cards your opponents have, there can be an element of guess-work as to how they're doing. And by the way: if it is your first game, you simply MUST play it with the intermediate-scoring rule! That helps a lot, since it painfully reveals the reality of how scoring works in the game. Without it, you will be in for some nasty surprises at game-end. But, if each player has played Concordia at least once, there's really no need for it.  The second negative is that Concordia is just a smidgeon too long for what it offers you. Other than that, it is a wonderfully deep game with a mere four pages of rules!",124361,Concordia
899296,amacleod,8,"It's a little like Carcassonne, but:  -Kingdomino is much, much quicker and with much simpler rules  -in spite of that, it is a much deeper game -the themeing and art of Kingdomino makes Carcassonne look like it's dripping with theme!  Considerably drier than Carcassone; but for what you get in the game, Kingdomino is probably the best filler out there!",204583,Kingdomino
1015477,amacleod,8,"Pasted on theme, but there's no glue showing here, folks! Breathtakingly beautiful!  Lightly themed in terms of game play, but nicely themed, nevertheless. Now I tend not to be a fan of worker placement type games....but Stone Age is one glorious exception!",34635,Stone Age

1035187,amacleod,8.7,"When I first read the rules, I thought, ""At last! A worker placement game where the mechanics perfectly marry the theme!"" Then I played it. No, the theme is NOT pasted on; but the link between theme and gameplay is certainly looser than it might first appear. This could have been considerably alleviated if minis had been used instead of cubes for the various adventurers, like in Empires:Age of Discovery; but then the retail price would have skyrocketed. Not that any of that matters: it's a fun game, regardless! The art is great, except for the somewhat bland board. Player interaction is fairly strong....and often cutthroat. Gobs of luck for a worker placement game! Perhaps Lords of Waterdeep is the gateway game to worker placement games?",110327,Lords of Waterdeep

This works as a filler, being so short, but also as a main game of a session, as it has plenty of both strategic and tactical thinking. Awesome, and most people I introduced it to were impressed.

I played it a lot when I was younger, but now do so much less often. Essentially it has become a ""filler,"" and I rather feel bad about that. I admit that my rating is based in part on nostalgia and respect rather than on the austere criteria set forth by BGG! (Actually it's a compromise between the 10 I think I ought to give it and the lower rating that would reflect how often I actually want to play it in comparison with newer games.) I don't consider myself very good at chess--I find that I make the same kinds of mistakes over and over, and on the whole I find the experience of playing Euros more satisfying. But I feel like a traitor in saying that, and chess will always have an appeal for me, if only because of its classic status.",171,Chess

Initially I found the luck frustrating, but I have learned that much of my frustration came from an overly simplistic understanding of how to place settlements, which led to my not having settlements on a broad enough variety of numbers and resources. Initial placement is maybe a bit too important, but as I have gotten better at that aspect of the game I've enjoyed the game as a whole much more.",13,Catan

324189,amaperera,10,"This is THE solitaire board game for me. It exemplifies emergent story over narrative, and paints a picture of the adventures of your godlike avatar through a hostile world with expertise. Unlike many other adventure games that try to pump you with books worth of flavour text and pages of backstory, this game will tell your story through your deeds.  But all that aside, the mechanisms in this game are intensely satisfying. This is absolutely an optimisation puzzle, and why I won't play it with more than 2 players. Every turn, you're left with a hand of cards over which you puzzle, and when you think you're out of options, you realise you were missing something after all.   What an excellent game.

Thousands of cards and events, monsters and characters to buy, which makes the mood just perfect for a game night. Many expansions where every expansion brings something new to the game and you can make your own version of Arkham Horror. The theme is great interpretated in the game. The fact that it's a hard cooperative game makes it even more fun when you finally beat the old one.   What can I say? Everything with Cthulhu is a bit better. ",15987,Arkham Horror

We played it every sunday for almost an year and never got tired of it.   Perfect balanced game where it almost every time the winner is declared in the last round. Good idea and well executed in the game where the discussions makes the game into something extra. It helps with the expansions, but throw away the New Caprica board! And of course, it´s always fun to throw your friends in the brig or out of the air lock.  Love it!",37111,Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game

That being said, I employ a considerable number of outside systems/supplies to make tracking and organizing the campaign easier, and I would rank this game lower if I stuck with the game-supplied tokens for monster health, and didn't buy an organizer and 5th/6th player decks. I also normally don't factor in price unless it's unusually high/low, and the price *would* drop it another point if there wasn't so much game to be had here. Everyone in my group loves this, and with the assistance of Google Sheets and some nudging/fudging to keep the campaign flowing (there's simply too many scenarios to explore to make barely losing a scenario worth holding us back), I think we have many, many more sessions of enjoyment with this game.",174430,Gloomhaven

Also, rules are totally arbitrary and don't follow any sort of thematic logic (you control tiles by emptying them?): this could have been a game about mice in a maze, collecting different sorts of cheese, or whatever. As for the look and the components, everything is gorgeous and nicely made, but I am a bit puzzled by the clash in the illustrations for the Djinns, which don't fit the rest of the game's look. My last rant is that setup is a bit complicated, and the game is definitely on the long side (it could be called ""The Djinns of Analysis-Paralysis"").

256998,Amitar,9,Very good game. The cards basically allow you to break the rules. Easy rules and lots of game play depth.,93,El Grande
520158,Amitar,8.5,"Good game, fun to play.  Doesn't really make a difference to me who wins or loses, the hunt is the fun part. I want to play this game again.  I think my rating will rise by another play.",10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill
635819,Amitar,9,"This game is a classic for a reason, it just does everything right without going overboard.",822,Carcassonne
663448,Amitar,8,"Nice light, card driven wargame.  The bits are like army men you played with as a kid.  Cool!  Recommend you check out the extra scenerios on the DOW website.  Very easy to learn and the cards are well balanced.  A great wargame without the massive rules. Always fun to play.",10630,Memoir '44

105434,amitche1,10,"If you can get 6 people together for 4+ hours, there is nothing short of an orgy that would be more satisfying to do than play thrones.  The main mechanic is stolen from Diplomacy, but the theme and flavor of the additional mechanics make it 100x more fun to play than Kissinger's favorite pastime.  In addition to the war game, you've got bidding, hand management, asymmetrical board positions, strong social play, and a light co-op element.  There's an expansion that makes it playable with 4 players, but you really want 5-6.",103343,A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)
175508,amitche1,10,"This is just about the greatest game out there.  It's a hand management game with a very strong social/bluffing aspect, but what makes it so entertaining is the ""take that"" element where a few cards can completely upend the game.  I haven't come close to playing all the aliens involved, but I look forward to going through them all in a game that I will keep for life.  Update: there's too many aliens. At least half of them are unnecessarily complex or just too strained of an idea.  I'll be chopping my deck down to avoid the stink bombs that get in the way of the gameplay. ",39463,Cosmic Encounter
280945,amitche1,10,"Pandemic is one of the best cooperative games, and the legacy version is much better.  The legacy format synergizes so well with the co-op aspect; your play group will bond as you work through the changes on the board and repeatedly experience the thrill of opening new boxes of components/rules.  If the last few months of play are a bit less exciting (they repeat a mechanic that gets a bit boring) than the first half of the game, it's only because those first six months are about as great a game experience as you can have. ",161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1
291238,amitche1,10,"It's so good. Great combat system, really fun missions, and impressive value/variety. The fact that a year after release the biggest complaints on BGG are about storage tells you it's a winner. ",174430,Gloomhaven
319221,amitche1,10,"One of the most consistently competitive games I have played.  It's an economic game of efficiencies where players battle in three arenas (for territory on the map, for resources on the board, and for power plants on the market) while a unique balancing mechanic manipulates turn order to allow players who have fallen behind to charge back in.  The only randomness comes from the power plant market, but this has enough of an impact to keep the game fresh every time you play, as a strategy that worked for you before may not be feasible the next time.",2651,Power Grid
489411,amitche1,10,"The game of games for 2 players.  The card event/play system is fantastic at creating tension and forcing hard tactical choices, while the map play provides context and opportunities for strategic planning.  The cards themselves are fun to read as the inevitable march towards global socialism unfolds before your eyes.  I've had fun just watching two friends play.  It's not that hard to teach the rules to someone willing to dive in and accept a loss in their first game.  ",12333,Twilight Struggle
666138,amitche1,9,"A great party game because it's fun, challenging, and prompts some hilarious discussions, but also because it's easy for people to jump in and out of teams without ruining the game.  To me, the theme is non-existent and they should have printed more words with fewer maps in the box; however, this is a great game for 6+ people.  It's borderline playable with 4.",178900,Codenames
872123,amitche1,8,Deck building with a board works great. I think the initial board is maybe too short to allow your deck to get set up.  I think the space version addresses this. Still tons of fun. ,201808,Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure

I hate apps in board games, but dangit! The app works so well. It makes the adventure and mystery so bloody neat. It's just a bunch of fun.   There are definitely some flaws in the execution. But the game is so unique and interesting regardless, it's hard not to enjoy it.*  *Still buying expansions since my original comment. Still love it.

It has some of the flavor of a 4x game, but it's actually a pretty typical construction and resource management Euro ramped up with a cool theme, cool bits, and cool variable races.   Love the commitment to a full on fantasy theme. And it's fun! It's on the medium-heavy side of the complexity spectrum, but I think it's pretty darn intuitive. The design is so clean it makes me happy.",120677,Terra Mystica

So that's a pretty good design!  It's still a dice game in a lot of ways, there is definitely a good amount of luck. But there's also a lot of decisions that really work in this context. I'm impressed. I don't think a single other dice game has every proven to me that strategy really matters AND given me multiple routes to try with my strategy.",132531,Roll for the Galaxy

It's a very good game, but I don't love how you have to play.   I suppose this fits the theme well in the backstabbing, high stakes sense. Minus how much more powerful I think the houses should actually feel in battle (combat resolution is not so thematic). And it is a bit weird that you can hold ""the iron throne"" without holding King's Landing... actually, everything about the power tokens is thematically very odd.",103343,A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)

383748,Amuny,10,"Clear 10 out of 10 for me.  I had low expectations for this one, as many videos portrayed it as extremely hard, to the point it almost looked painful to play. But at some point, being so highly rated by many, I had to give it a try.  Took 3 nights of play to end up buying every extensions for it. Lost Legion is a must if you enjoy this game. I enjoyed every minute of play, both solo and co-op. Haven't tried PvP yet.  I think it's actually fairly easy to explain once you get how it works. Reading through the book and learning it the first time is rough. Honestly, I feel like the rulebook is a little bit everywhere. I've been able to introduce people to this game fairly quickly with a 15-20min wrap up and slow start.  But as a strategic deck card, I definitely think it's unmatched. It's unmatched by a lot of things actually. Many similar games are a pain to setup with millions of tokens and miniature, they get slow through these because you need to prep dozen of figures, tiles and everything.  Mage Knight takes like 5 minutes to set up, and the flow of the game is actually incredible. It just feels good. Even with multiple players around the table, you can discuss together and try to see how you can do this same move in a more optimal way.   There's little to keep track of, every character feels incredibly different (Lost Legion adding a 2nd specific cards help to this), the skills are meaningful, easy to understand...  I have nothing but good words for this one and I could keep going for a while. A must try for players looking for a good brain teaser and a strategic game with an RPG feel.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game

706852,amusedleg,9,"This is the first modern boardgame we ever bought.  The theme is dumb, the artwork is so so (for me) and on the surface it seems too simple.  But boy is this a fun way to spend an hour or so.  This is a classic in our family, one we return to again and again.  A classic.",129622,Love Letter
845575,amusedleg,9,"I love this game, way more than I should, given what it is.  The strategy matrix that this one employs just goes straight into my brain.  I love this so much that my kids won't play it with me.",148228,Splendor
1000791,AmusedToDeath,9,"solitaire (2x)  This rating is for the game in general, not for the core box. Having only one core box and nothing else makes for a nice introduction, but not for a nice replayable game. Two core boxes makes it better, but the game starts to really shine when you buy more, more, more. It's money hungry, keep that in mind when you are thinking about buying into this LCG.   Would you want to replay the scenarios? The replayability is limited if you only care about the story and maybe the branching paths. The replayability increases if you also care about trying the different investigators. The replayability seems endless if you love trying different investigator combinations and different decks. I personally even love just thinking about the player cards I want to include.  The campaigns are varied and try different things. Some of these things are more fun than others of course.  The Chaos Bag is what I like least about this game, but it turned out to be not nearly as bad as I feared it would be. I do play on easy, however.  ",205637,Arkham Horror: The Card Game

119,Anaconda,10,One of the games that lit up my interest for boardgames again. Very playable and it's popular amongst the non-gamers too.,822,Carcassonne
34706,Anaconda,10,"This is the ultimate game. Period. I've managed to quit, but I've still got the cards. Compared to it, all other games with cards is ""just not Magic"".",463,Magic: The Gathering
76901,Anaconda,9,A very good filler with few players. Works with the 3-player variant too. 100% theme. And it's a fun game with nice mechanics. And logic helps where the rules doesn't explain.,3955,BANG!
110200,Anaconda,10,"I've played this a bit on Brettspielwelt. Back then I didn't find this very amusing. But when I tried the real version with friends that were on the same level as me, it was much much better.  I understand why this is the number one game. It's easy yet complex. It got lots of mechanism that actually work well. It's got multiple ways to victory. Comboes and stratgegy is very viable.   Last but not least the rulebook is well written and has the answer to everything! Maybe you won't find the answer in one paragraph, but then you will find it in another.",3076,Puerto Rico
185057,Anaconda,7,The original monopoly played with the standard rules is not as bad as I remembered the other variants to be. Even though there is a lot of luck involved and you can easily go from rags to riches and also the other way around.,1406,Monopoly
188210,Anaconda,8,"Nice little game. I picked it up as a gift for my better half. We tried it out and it was easy to learn, and pretty fun for such a short game. It's pretty the same when playing 2, 3 and 4 players.",16992,Tsuro
332888,Anaconda,7,"A classic that almost everyone can learn how to play. It's got simple rules and a lot of luck is involved. Too much for my fancy, but still.  Usually the real battles happen outside the board!",181,Risk

Awesome! If you like this game consider including the expansion as it makes it even more interesting!",126163,Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar
72753,Anakin1981,10,Awesome game! Highly strategic with lots to think about each time! Worth every last penny!,120677,Terra Mystica
85987,Anakin1981,10,"I was a fan of Hero Quest as a kid and I enjoyed it very much (even though I was the DM almost every time... grrr...) and when I tried Mage Knight I fell in love with it from the first sight! A very beautiful game with pre-painted figures of the Mage Knights all with their different powers, excellent artwork and a fantasy setting that has many elements of a euro game that makes the adventure not that frustrating with the constant rolling of dice and random events! Give this one some tries and it's going to reward you! With the expansion it's even better! The only drawback is that it lasts for too long.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game
108208,Anakin1981,10,El Grande is a classic one that the only complain that I have is that it suffers from the gang up on the leader aspect that's common in area control games and this is due to the fact that the score is open for all players to see. Other than that an elegant design that stands the test of time! A true mastepiece that is easy to teach but hard to master. I highly recommmend the Big Box edition that has every expansion included!,93,El Grande
146573,Anakin1981,10,"Excellent game, almost no luck at all. It's one of those games that I love playing like Caylus, Luna or In the Year of the Dragon for example. Very simple to explain and learn, hard on the desicions on your way to win!",35677,Le Havre
155108,Anakin1981,10,"A classic and excellent game, ""grandfather"" to strategy games! I wonder how many people that game has raised and how many were influenced by it! I consider myself lucky because I learned it as 5 year old kid and I'm since then a huge fan of the game. Absolutely magnificent!",171,Chess
157103,Anakin1981,10,Probably Knizia's masterpiece that game has so much strategy and depth that you can't find in many games in the 1.5 hour that it lasts! Back in 1997 Knizia was way ahead of its time! The Mayfair 2nd edition is awesome and it includes the advanced version with a double sided board for more variety in your games.,42,Tigris & Euphrates

Easy to learn and fast to play with a lot of strategy, it's so awesome that doesn't compare with the previous version in quality terms. A game that keeps evοlving! Well done! The only ""complain"" is why did the developers think it can be a 3 or 4 player game! To be honest that's a 2-player only game for me and that's how a play it! One of the best abstracts out there with ""a touch"" of theme...",194655,Santorini

400079,Anakin1981,10,A very interesting 2-player asymmetrical game during the Cold War. Congratulations to the designers for creating such a nice historical game that is easy to play in a couple of hours. It has a bit of luck and randomness but I guess it's due to the nature of the game and the aspect of uncertain events in war games but I'm no expert here to have a clear opinion. The 2015 Deluxe Edition that I own has excellent production values and it's truly nice to see when it's being played on the table.,12333,Twilight Struggle
467536,Anakin1981,10,I was sceptical when I read that this is a game that you're a farmer. Seriously? Well I decided to give it a shot and I was instantly drawn into what is one of the best worker placement/crisis management games out there! A fantastic game and among my favourites! It scales very good with any number (haven't played it with 5...) and with such a huge variety with the different decks (even in only the base game there are 3 decks!) every play is different and you have to carefully plan what you'll do while you keep an eye to your opponents and try to see what cards they're playing and try to take the resources and actions you can before they do! The solo experience is also very good with it's puzzly feeling!,31260,Agricola
505584,Anakin1981,8,"This is one super-filler game! It plays very fast, supports from 3 to 6 players and it's one of the easiest games to teach!

732108,Anakin1981,9,"Sometimes you need an easier game to play with your gaming group and have in your collection. This is the best of the 3 (the other 2 being Stone Age and Lords of Waterdeep) most known lighter worker placement games. It plays fast, it's easy to learn, very beautiful and has the expansions (especially Tuscany) to add a more serious flavour and reduce randomness. If you have to pick only one of these three it has my vote.",183394,Viticulture Essential Edition
738909,Anakin1981,8,"One of the best 2 player games out there! Easy to learn and to play but with excellent decisions all the way! Very beautiful game, the best Gameworks has to offer to counter games like those in the Kosmos 2-player series.",54043,Jaipur
831265,Anakin1981,8,"One of the best party games out there! It plays very quick, I love the theme and it has no player elimination!",128882,The Resistance: Avalon
915888,Anakin1981,9,One of the best card games out there and my personal favourite of course! I highly recommend this to everyone! A bit hard with the iconography at first but when you get used to it you'll be rewarded by the game. It's excellent with 2 players and including the 1st and 2nd expansions makes the game even better because it adds the solo experience and the drafting of the planets before starting! Adding a 5th and 6th player and the goals is also a nice feature.,28143,Race for the Galaxy
960791,Anakin1981,7,Excellent implementation of the Spaghetti Western feeling in a party/deduction game with player elimination. I prefer it to Night Hunters for example (which is another popular of the genre) due to the fact that it can be a lot more strategic and love the theme of the Wild West. The downtime is that it might drag a bit sometimes or people might get eliminated too early but that's due to the nature of gunfighting. After all it's funny even to be on the table talking with the others. It surely depends on your playing companions. It get's better with Dodge City and we play with the tournament rules for scoring and always with Spaghetti Western music in the backgroung when playing!,3955,BANG!
973433,Anakin1981,9,"A so simple yet so addicting game! I love it! It's probably my favourite of ""The Big 3"" as it has more strategy involved and so many nice expansions that can made that game even more puzzling!",822,Carcassonne

My first introduction to ""real"" gaming, back in 94.  Revolutionary concept.  I loved the game, played it daily, spent hours deck building every week, etc.  I blissfully ignored the money-grubbing tactics of WotC (Type 2?  You mean, I HAVE to buy new cards to play in tourneys?), played T1 games with my friends, etc.  I even bought several boxes of each set, although I only played with MAYBE 5% of the cards.  Then, WotC went one step too far, and lost a customer.  I sold my 15,000 card collection (Alpha through Urza's Saga or whatever).  Why?    FOIL CARDS.     A few years later, I acquired a few collections, and have ~25,000 cards now.  I rarely play with them, and have no intention of buying any new cards.

The clever hand management rule of not being able to rearrange cards in hand and playing from right to left forces some of the most fun trading and negotiating you can have.

988085,AnalyzerOfGames,8.5,"One of the few games that actually supports the concept of ""strategy"", by allowing you to decide exactly how you want to go about fighting. It allows an immense range of creativity and planning, while still leaving your eventual fate up to a bit of luck and tactical skill.  Possibly, among all the clones and competitors there is a better game, but I have not played any of them.  Personally, I'm happy to build decks out of a static pool of a few hundred cards. I don't see any value in constantly purchasing booster packs and new sets. The financial complaint that many have against the game seems to be more an issue of them, than the game. Getting into an arms race of finding bigger and better cards is a pointless exercise. The game is fun when you have two decks that are competitive with one another, not when you have a deck that can wallop all other decks, and you can make paired decks with any starting set of cards to choose from.  The principal issue with the game is really one that there's an intrinsic issue with a game that allows creativity, comboing, and synergies. In one deck, a card might be worth 1 mana. In another deck, that same card might be worth 10 mana. In actuality, it might be priced as 4 mana. It's fundamentally impossible to assign an accurate price to any card, and this makes it impossible to compare decks to one another through any other means than dueling a few dozen times. And, of course, it drives the engine that propels people on the spending frenzy to find cards which are underpriced in mana compared to their strength in game.  I doubt that this problem has been solved by any other Magic-like game, except by making cards with powers that are non-creative and purely additive. And that's just not interesting. But so I don't feel like there's value in trying other games of the same type. You may as well stick to Magic as it has the most variety available, and the largest player base.",463,Magic: The Gathering

Normally we prefer resource gathering efficiency engine building titles like Puerto Rico, Race for the Galaxy or Agricola, but I dropped El Grande on them last night and we all had a pleasant experience.   I prefer Shogun's added depth, and - though it in some ways 'makes' the game - the frequent special scoring actions bogged down the play for me. However, this criticism speaks more to my expectation of it offering a faster table dynamic than any inherent issue with the game. For what it is, El Grande is very subtle and elegant. It's one of those games that evokes a sense of depth one can't really fathom till they get into the experience.

So, I caved and bought Descent (and two additional expansions within a couple weeks).  I don't see myself ever getting bored of this.  Playing one player is surprisingly fun. Playing with more is even more fun.

21007,anatana,10,"Maybe the ultimate engine builder? A major sense of progression and building, both in your own tableau and in the shared terraforming process. You need to consider what others are doing spatially to try to max your score, and when to push the terraforming in order to end the game (or prolong it conversely), but solitaire in many ways. Still very satisfying, even in a loss or close game it is highly enjoyable. Drafting is required.  I've changed my rating on this quite a few times but it's staying at 10 now. I'm always happy to play it, and always enjoy playing it. You absolutely must draft though, never play with the auto terraform, always include all the cards, and venus is always in (especially at 4+ players) as it gives way more options",167791,Terraforming Mars
175246,anatana,10,"many plays: The only reason this isn't quite a 10 is because of the length, and the fact that I would rather play a conquest than any of the shorter scenarios (which are fun in their own right). But with the right people (or solo) and with time, it's incredible.  provisional rating after one solo play. I actually will be surprised if I play this with other people, since my gaming group has skewed light, and I literally cannot imagine the AP and downtime involved with a 4 player game with newbies. Good lord, my first solo game of conquest took me from 9:30 PM to 3AM (this seems insanely long, and I had just revealed my first city in the final night phase with no real hope of assaulting it). That being said, the game is fun as hell, trying to puzzle out what the best options are with the hand you draw each turn...feeling your power grow as you level up (I found a spell in a mage tower that let me recruit units for free from wherever!), truly sweet. Very glad I picked it up.  3/30/15 Revised up to 9.5 after an EIGHT HR solo conquest victory (168 pts wooot). I need to get faster, but the experience of making the best of your hand and growing in power is just sublime.   edit#2: Played this 2p using the Druid Nights scenario, and we knocked it out in just over an hour. Having someone else there actually sped me up a bit I think, and having a better grasp on the game mechanics. It was a damn close game in terms of overall VP and he won only on achievement scoring after I took a huge lead during night #2. Still loving this",96848,Mage Knight Board Game

People generally feel frustrated by the tension, while even on a first play I felt that the tension makes for a brilliant puzzle. Drafting the cards makes an already pleasant experience sublime. Hint: when not playing solo (a very fun experience in its own right!) learning when to take first player is EXTREMELY important!",31260,Agricola
481409,anatana,9,"I liked this WAY more than I expected to. The draft is delicious and presents some difficult choices, and allows for some planning as well. The area control works well, death has some sting but it never feels mean, and you can turn losses into wins if you plan it well. The blind card play for combat feels very fair as well, since losers get their cards back, and the cards have enough trickeration that you can never be fully sure what the right play is. Leveling up your clan seems to be important above all else, I got +50 pts from level bonuses at game's end, which was nearly half my points. Our quests had people working different areas, would be interesting to see more overlap, although we had PLENTY of conflict. Would be down to play again any time.  also: this is one of the few games I would recommend a broken token for. You aren't getting the expansions in the box without it",170216,Blood Rage
482871,anatana,9,"Not as tense as agricola, and doesn't quite carry the sublime feeling the former game has of pulling everything together just at the right time, nor does it have a card draft which really elevates the 'gric into gamer nirvana. But it is highly entertaining, and much more accessible for non gamers. My non gamer gf loves it (and loathes agricola) and though the box can be as intimidating as hell, the rules are VERY well written. It doesn't take that long to play, the components are fantastic, and it gives a very satisfying sense of creation (more so than even agricola) as you watch your farm/cave take three dimensional shape in front of you. The price point is the only thing keeping me from recommending this wholeheartedly to everyone.  Played multiple times solo as part of the 2015 10x10. Not as good as agricola solo because it lacks the legacy element of keeping an occupation and building on your previous score, but still good fun and enough options to keep things interesting.

There are tons of dice rolls in this game, but you can mitigate very well and its all about planning this out and keeping track of what others want and what they have in the race for the goals.

214982,anaturalharmonic,10,"An amazing, challenging, puzzle.  One of the greatest solitaire games that will never leave my collection.  The only thing that knocks it down for me is that (for some reason that I cannot explain) the rules just do not stick in my head for long term.  The rules exceptions and details make sense in the moment but they somehow don't tie to the theme in a way that I can remember them.  Consequently I only play this when I have time to play it a few times in a row (which is rarely these days...)  EDIT (4-20-2018) I was wrong.  I don't care that the rules can be hard to remember.  I just played this game again.  It is a remarkable game.  There is nothing like it.  It is worth a bit of rules complexity.  It is a 9.9 to me.  Since I don't do decimal values, there you go.  It is a 10.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game
241279,anaturalharmonic,10,My favorite gaming experience I have had from start to finish.  My wife and I still talk about moments that happened in that game every once in a while.  Is it perfect mechanically throughout?  There are some objectives that I found boring in terms of the puzzle/gameplay.  But *most* of the time the game-play was amazing... and the story... well... you have to play it to make your own decision.  I loved it.,161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1
344613,anaturalharmonic,9,"This might be my favorite mid weight euro and it is the best ""next-step"" game for newer gamers that have had a taste of the hobby.  And it is damn fun even for veterans.  The theme is so easy to get into for most people and all of the mechanisms tie into the theme beautifully.  For me, the 9 rating is for Viticulture + Tuscany.  The extended board makes it a 9 for me.  Without it Viticulture would be an 8 for me.  The randomness of the visitors is a bit too high on the basic board.  You can mitigate the randomness with the Tuscany board and strategy opens up a bit.",183394,Viticulture Essential Edition

489397,anaturalharmonic,10,"This game is perfect in every way.  If you are in to what it is doing, then you can find no better game (imo).  This game pays off for any level of player.  Whether you are a novice that just gets into the theme or a veteran that has learned the intricacies of the deck, you can have fun on your level.  I could play casually with a new player, try some crazy strategy that I have never tried, and have a ton of fun!  Or, I could brain burn a game with a high level player, get my ass handed to me, and I would still have fun.     (Please excuse me for a short digression about what makes a perfect 10 game for me.)  As of this writing I have 4 games that I rate a 10 and I have come to realize what I love most in board gaming.  It isn't the genre of game per-se (although I have my preferences).  And certainly, the best games need to be mechanically solid (but not necessarily perfect).  It has more to do with how the theme meshes with the game.  All four games have great themes that meld so well with the game-play, that I actually feel the theme emotionally when I play them.  Other games that I love (like Viticulture for example) meld theme with the mechanisms beautifully, but I don't really FEEL the theme emotionally (I don't feel like a wine-maker when I play viticulture, but it does tell a nice story).  Antiquity, for example, tells an interesting story of struggling your way through the harsh middle ages and I actually FEEL the angst of the struggle while I am playing it (and oh by the way, it is also the greatest heavy Euro of all mechanically, strategically, and tactically in-my-not-at-all-humble-opinion).  Another example, I just recently played Gaia Project.  I preliminary rated the game a 9 and that is likely where it will stay.  Mechanically the game is crunchy and very compelling.  But I don't think it could ever rise to a 10 for me due to the lack of any theme that I care about. Concordia and Puerto Rico are similar.  Robinson Crusoe is on the other side of the coin, it dripping with theme and makes me *feel* the theme, but is lacking slightly in the strategy and decisions that I want in a game.  But it tells a damn good story.  (Digression complete.)  Twilight struggle doesn't just make me think about and experience the cold war, it makes me FEEL the tension of the cold war.  And oh-by-the-way, it is one of the most mechanically perfect games I have every played.  The depth rivals any of the great deep strategy games of all time.",12333,Twilight Struggle

Asylum is a fantastic scenario and I look forward to more. Only problem is the price tag for an experience that's only great once (per story), but the experience wouldn't have been so great without the story being consumed.",146508,T.I.M.E Stories

596737,Anavrinn,10,"I've never played a game of Agricola I didn't like. It appealed to everyone I've played with. But something about it doesn't entirely sit right for me - the available actions feel too obvious and the theme (or art) is too whimsical. The constant feeling of never having an adequate farm makes the struggle feel frustrating. It's a brilliant design but I'd rather play more nuanced and less punishing worker placement games.  EDIT: IGNORE EVERYTHING ABOVE. With 18 plays, this is a clear 10/10 and a contender to the best worker placement game.",31260,Agricola

The gameplay thankfully is also top notch, it is quick, fluid and has enough depth and strategy for repeated play.  I would put this in the medium weight category and would be happy to teach this to casual and hardcore gamers alike.    It's only January but I can see this being on lots of peoples top 10's by the end of the year.

The shop and traveling stages between the quests are great but somewhat lacking in length. It would be nice to have a little more moments for the hero characters to be involved in other incidents outside of the incredibly competitive quests.  The game plays incredibly well and is overall quite balanced. ,104162,Descent: Journeys in the Dark (Second Edition)

5066,Andarel,10,"I've played a ton of the original (Ukrainian version) and am happy with the American version as well.  I'll play it pretty much whenever, and it's a damned solid co-op with an interesting twist - though it's a lot harder on the ghost than it is on the players.",181304,Mysterium
7824,Andarel,10,"Game is good, and uses dice well. Feels pretty different from Race, while being nice and familiar.",132531,Roll for the Galaxy
240466,Andarel,10,"For the sake of brevity, I'll summarize here: Race for the Galaxy is pretty much the perfect game.  It's an unforgiving, thinky, brutal multi-use card game where you're trying to claw an engine together faster than your opponent and ride that engine to victory.  The cards are fantastically designed and well-balanced, and the gameplay leads heavily to trying to understand and take advantage of your opponent's phase calls.  Tons of indirect player interaction, and a good mix of strategy and tactics (though leaning towards tactics, there's definitely both).  Combine this with great art and visual design and a ten-minute playtime and we have a winner.  For plays, counting a combination of BGA, Keldon's, and offline in that order of quantity.  However, each component is still pretty sizeable.",28143,Race for the Galaxy
360063,Andarel,9,,163412,Patchwork
363366,Andarel,9,"Fantastic game, and a nice mix of strategy and dice-rolling shenanigans.  Somewhat long, and does need the right group, but relatively intuitive and generally hilarious as long as people get into it at all.  Bonus points for being well-written - the Mythos is well-represented, the art is great, and the rulebook doesn't suck.  Only problem is that the research and location encounter decks are a bit spare, but Forsaken Lore more than fixes that.",146021,Eldritch Horror
632482,Andarel,9,"A fun brain-burner, and my favorite heavy worker-placement so far.  Takes some time, and I prefer playing with 3-4 but 5 works fine if needed.  Much more direct player interaction than most games in its genre, and can be extremely unforgiving.  Excellent game.",18602,Caylus
652417,Andarel,9,"Netrunner is a great game, though plagued by a few systemic issues - mostly that people hivemind really hard on the meta, and that it can have extremely high variance (though I'm not sure how it compares to Magic: the Gathering's variance which can be pretty nasty sometimes).  It's got solid mechanics, fantastic theme, and good gameplay that doesn't take too long - a winning combination right there.  On the other hand, I haven't had quite as much time for deckbuilding recently...",124742,Android: Netrunner
659011,Andarel,8,"It's a very fun game with the right group, but without the right group it falls horribly flat.  Given that it can take a deceptively long amount of time with AP, it's a good game that I don't play that often.",98778,Hanabi
774308,Andarel,7,"The best thing about Tsuro is that I can put it on the table and non-gamers can figure it out in two minutes.  Not the thinkiest of games (at least at high player counts) but it's cleverly designed and plays very fast.  Beautiful production values, too.",16992,Tsuro

867208,Andarel,9,"An extremely clever engine-builder that has an interesting theme and absolutely beautiful components.  Plays very well and deceptively quick - the playtime drops dramatically as players get more experienced, and the game is all about timing your actions and optimizing  your race's abilities.  Balance is fantastic, though the Darklings are a bit strong and the Fakirs a bit weak, and there's a ton of skill in reading the objectives and other people's picks and grabbing a race (of the giant pile in the box) that plays well with the current spread.  The rules themselves are clean and straightforward, though the rulebook's not great, and the races all play very differently.  Expansion at Essen this year!",120677,Terra Mystica

You should prep players however to avoid pointing out better or more optimal moves, and to just let the scores do the talking at the end of the game.

We started playing ultimate splendor because it is the two of us. We just go until all the cards are done. Find this pointless though about halfway through because pretty soon it's just picking up cards because the gems are worthless. Never have had a bad game and never will. I wish they would come out with an expansion to add more players. Other than that a perfect game on our shelf.,148228,Splendor

Simple, not too complex, easy to teach and learn, and while there is not much player interaction there is still tension (looking around the table, seeing what people have, getting angry when someone snags a piece you wanted to buy but it's not your turn..) Every time I teach someone they have loved it. Have never had a bad time playing this game. That is why I give it a wholehearted 10 out of 10.

First few times it seems hard to get positive points and that's only happened once to me, but I am so ready for another go to try and make it happen! So much fun and so worth your penny.

501321,AndersM,9.5,This is one of my all time favourite games. The only problem with MtG is that it cost you a lot of money. The game is like a shark. It needs to move forward constantly otherwise it would stop working. If they stopped giving out new cards an optimal tactics would soon appear I think and it wouldn't be so fun anymore.

Also fun to build, try to block other players and plan in the beginning where to put your starting markers. The robber is surely also part of the games success.

521407,AndersonCouncil,8.5,"Mysterium is a nice evolution of the dream-like card guessing game Dixit, of which I am a big fan, by adding more story to the game and really high production values.   It's hard to say that this would ""replace"" Dixit for me as so many others seem to have settled on because the truth is that it is quite difficult to play as the Ghost and the set up time can be quite long given how many bits and pieces need sorting out before you can start playing.   I also feel that the variety in the cards is not as good in the base game with some elements of the Person/Room/Weapon cards not really represented on any of the cards at all. But this is less of a concern now as I have bought a couple of the expansion packs which add more cards and at a push it could probably be played with Dixit cards, of which I own most of the sets.  So while I still have a soft spot for Dixit, I really do love Mysterium and picked up a copy of my own after buying it for a friend.",181304,Mysterium
673206,AndersonCouncil,8,"This game is gorgeous to look at and a lot of fun to play, especially because of the whole ""are you the traitor?"" aspect to it.   The game is challenging if the knights don't work together closely but not so punishing that you never win. Many of our games have come down to the wire with the outcome of a particular quest being crucial for a win or loss.  Days of Wonder has produced a fantastic game - I only wish they had released more expansions, possibly with more quests that you could decide to swap in or out as you choose.",15062,Shadows over Camelot
1030851,AndersonCouncil,8,"(Own 2)  I am one of the many that rank ""Memoir 44"" highly as I love the simplicity of the rules, board and pieces. It's strengths lie in the relatively quick play time and the option to keep things simple while also allowing experienced players to add more rules and complexity in the subsequent packs that have been released.   Those that don't like this game usually levy the criticism of ""it's not a war game"" which is fair enough but [i]is[/i] a game about war. Who cares if it doesn't have all of the stats and modifiers that other, more in depth war games have - this game shines because of it's accessibility.  The vast array of official and fan generated scenarios mean that there is plenty of replay-ability here.   And finally, playing the game in the Overlord mode (I do it with 2 copies of the base game plus the Operation Overlord expansion pack) is a blast! I've tried it with 4 and while fun, the rule book clearly wants you to opt for 6 or even 8 instead as rules for 4 player games are not as clearly outlined.   Excellent game!",10630,Memoir '44

468682,andreas2402,8.5,"7 players. Won by 1 point. You better build cards that are worth 3 or more to ensure other's can't destroy them too easily. The leader is the most targeted person and easily recognizable.   thief and murderer are good for payback/fun or balancing the game. thief is ideal if players have lots of gold. mage if youve got bad cards.  mercenary is useful at the beginning (low gold count means 1 point buildings) and at the end to destroy other competitor's buildings.  architect if you dont have cards but not good if you already have several cards because then you most likely have to swap with the mage. can be great in the last round. priest is only good if you have blue cards.(the game rewards being aggressive, so no use for a defensive card)  merchant was target #1 in our group for murderer and thief, i wouldnt choose this card one person chose the king at the beginning 3 times but he knew he will get murdered eventually. i'd say if youre always one of the last players during the turn this card is favorable. and for yellow cards of course.  king's cards are usually worth a lot so they dont get destroyed easily. merchant's cards on the other hand are usually low cost. Makes merchant even more unattractive.  a lot of fun, but i recommend playing with up to 5/ max. 6 players. it takes too much time otherwise.  downtime is no problem because you ought to think about choosing the next card yourself. also need to look at how many cards/gold and how many points the others have.  extra points for 5 different colours seems hard to achieve.",478,Citadels
644537,andreas2402,8.5,"The problem,as mentioned, is that it's long, deep and only works with 4/5 pl. Also, due to very high interaction, tactics are employed instead of strategy (and considering this, the normal mode would take too long and the short mode is more suitable IMO. Why always plan for a short time frame if the game takes so long? Doesn't make sense.). Requires a lot of space, too. ",93,El Grande

353830,Andreloha,9.2,"Love this game! Only played solo (1 player or 2 players) so far, except once with a friend. I look forward to play it with 2-3 other players. Thankfully the expansion Forgotten Folks adds variability in solo as each race has a different optimization.  Love this game more than Agricola which is a great game as well, but more options in Caverna.",102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers

483090,Andreloha,9.8,"Great Game :) As I don't have a friend to play nearby, I Love to play it  as Coop and play 2 or 3 heroes (even 4 sometimes). Great fun and good challenge! Only weak points is many special rules which could be simplified sometimes. For example, we should be allowed up to 2 actions per turn (but only one move), it would speed up the game. Lost Legion expansion is great and had a lot of new possibilities.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game

But it does add a further element of luck (which mission card you get dealt). Unfortunately the mission cards differ in strength depending on how many players are playing. So that adds an element of unfairness to the game.  Still, the secret missions add a new source of tension and interest. So I still give this a 9 for the pure fun factor.

Played 2 player version with my wife - we loved it!!!  UPDATE: Played many more times now. It can be very frustrating when one gets targeted by an assassin, thief or magician (often unwittingly).   For this reason I'm not happy giving this game a 10, as I like everyone to have fun playing my games, and invariably there is someone who won't!  What's really clever is that it's a combination of an investment game (earning income, buying districts managing cards) and a screwage game (caused by the chaos of secretly choosing roles).  The secret may be balancing these 2 perspectives.  In the past I always treated it as an investment game, and often got whipped.

It does not play as well at the higher player counts, 6-7, but this was probably obvious to most people already.  The only issue is repetitive gameplay.

16193,andrewfoerster,10,"1-6(4)  Okay, so this game is gigantic, and has all sorts of crazy components.  It is very much a challenge to know if I prefer this to Agricola. I think they both do have a place.  Maybe I'm just too seasoned an Agricola player, but Caverna does feel quite a bit less tense than Agricola with the feeding and the need to grow your family, among other things.  And so, by its very nature, I guess Uwe had to compress many of the Agricola actions (getting fields and pastures going is easier, as is expanding your cave, and etc.) so that he could add something new and different (the adventuring). The game is fluid and takes out a bit of the mess of Agricola and it's nice that players can transition between the different tracks (adventuring and farming), but it doesn't feel much *more* than Agricola, just different. Enjoyable, though.  The big thing, of course, is the overload in getting the hundred community improvements upfront versus the cards. I understand Uwe's gradual move toward no luck, static setup games, but there is indeed something fun in looking at your initial hand of cards trying to suss out the synergies and the interactions and trying to build a game plan. That part of Agricola DID add a lot of interesting direction to any particular game session.",102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers
26809,andrewfoerster,10,"The Resistance is fantastic with an energetic group of folks and the roles work so much better than the plot cards from the base game. They add information to the game in a more predictable, organized way, and they help folks realize the information and strategy inherent in the game.  I still think that, regardless, there is a lot of data to process (and that the first mission team shouldn't automatically be accepted and that the first mission should necessarily automatically succeed or whatever), but the roles do help this reality set in.  It does, as many games of this ilk, suffer if all players aren't all expressive, and the less sociable can get a bit suppressed, but otherwise great fun.",128882,The Resistance: Avalon
67216,andrewfoerster,10,"1-5(3)  UPDATE: With three it's great. Loans come into play much more readily (and to great effect) and there is genuine contention over the different strategies. Two to three actions per round feels about right and the game becomes a really rich experience. Le Havre is very much a winner.  --------------------------------------------------------  UPDATE: Played again and I really enjoyed it.  It's got a different sort of tension than Agricola, but it's a constructive sort.  Only played with 2p and want to get more involved (impossible as that tends to be).  --------------------------------------------------------  I'll play this any time, but it lacks the tension of Agricola (in providing food).  There are a lot of cool mechanics at play here, but I never really get a feeling of where I'm at in the game, and some buildings just don't seem like they'd fit in.  I'll need to play more to get a better feeling for this.",35677,Le Havre
102292,andrewfoerster,10,,161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1
116052,andrewfoerster,10,"2-5(3)  With two it's very tight. The game can be as rich or poor as you make it (depending on how soon players pass), and there are several strategies to pursue, and seemingly all of which require some attention. Castle batches, buildings (both production and point buildings), favors, etc. I like the perfect information, the breadth of the decision tree, the game of chicken, trying to plan a turn (grabbing the most desirable spots, often the production buildings) while risking a pass. The goods all have different applications but still seem reasonably balanced. Gold, hard as it is to get, seems really potent, though. Interesting how this takes a while but still moves quickly and often feels like it ends ""too soon"".  Some AP in going through all the buildings and, at least with two, the Provost is more a threat than anything (you're often very reluctant to pay to activate him).",18602,Caylus
141910,andrewfoerster,10,"2  Great game.  The theme is great, the dynamics are fantastic, the sense of the history is great, the swings in the control are great.  Balance issues are fine to me because that's part of the game and its challenge.  The agony of playing a bad scoring card, or having to play one of your opponents action cards is invigorating.  The timing of scoring and the relevance of various regions is brilliant.  The theme and length puts off some people, but some people love it.",12333,Twilight Struggle
222286,andrewfoerster,9,"5-10(7)  UPDATE: The Avalon roles do way way more to keep this game lively than the plot cards ever did. Highly recommended.  -------------------------------------------------  UPDATE: A lot more interesting with the plot cards, on account of it's not merely just an interesting smoke-and-mirrors ""he said she said"" game, but rather something where information gets introduced into the game. I think it also improves the balance. A great social activity.  ---------------------------------------------------------  Played with five, which worked really well.  For what it is, this is excellent. We played this over and over. An effective traitor game where you have multiple means of gathering information: mission failure, team selection, and voting for the teams. Spies will often vote in bloc, and often conspicuously, say.  At points, the first rounds feel ""throwaway"" in that spies are too anxious to sabotage, and are sort of waiting for later rounds (in which the rebels have to choose their teams perfectly). But then, there is still team selection and voting (even if the missions pass). Given that spies know who each other are, their behavior can be noticeably different (and susceptible to groupthink).  Certain weaknesses are that it can depend a lot of the social elements and the dissembling, which may make it unenjoyable or difficult for some players. Also, some games can be right routs if the spies tip too early (though it's their fault!) or if the rebels just happen to stumble into winning teams. But with quick gameplay, I can't say that it ruins the experience at all.",41114,The Resistance
249023,andrewfoerster,10,"1-5(3,4)  Stressful, but in a good way.  It's rewarding to see your farm at the end, and I feel that the variety is enough here to create different plays each time through.  With additional players (I often play two) this becomes completely different and almost as if you have to relearn how to play. Of course I know how to play, but the different strategies and resource balances and actions, etc. can make a winning 2p strategy near useless 4p. Makes it all the more brilliant, and challenging.",31260,Agricola
279847,andrewfoerster,9,"4-12(6)  Okay, a really, really solid party game that's not quite as arbitrary as something like Apples to Apples. Will play differently with every group and will often be a riot, especially if the presenters and all get into it. Great, great game.  The only pratfall is that it can tend to fall into inside jokes / references too easily. In several groups there have been references to TV shows / books / etc. that only a few of the players have watched.",39856,Dixit
386193,andrewfoerster,9,"4-5(5)  I thought this was an excellent game. A classic. The king nicely limits your placement options (and also adds a crucial element of trying to locate the king and then, of course, trying to snag some of those nicer action cards. Also a nice ebb and flow of units from the provinces to the courts to the board and then back again.  I realize now we played the turn order mechanism wrong (we passed the first bid to the left), which may well have changed much of the game (I cannot ascertain). Certainly a tangible ""bash the leader"" element.  Others have said that El Grande is obsoleted by newer titles (Chaos in the Old World and Dominant Species being two that get mentioned). CitOW is enjoyable enough, it's got really cool variable powers and win conditions and an interesting game arc, but the rules are a bear to follow and explain, along with randomness in the combat (which is key to Khorne's win condition).  I enjoy Dominant Species a lot, but the obvious thing is its length. I like the variable powers here too (much more subtle than in CitOW), but it's a bit different from El Grande, with the growing and changing landscape, as exploration occurs and resources enter and leave and tundra expands and populations migrate. El Grande is just so much more ... [i]Euro[/i] ... cleaner and a purer distillation of the area control.",93,El Grande
484779,andrewfoerster,9,"2-4(4)  I didn't exactly enjoy this when I played on the computer against an AI ... and (with some of the other games I've played against AI) I think I should just stop boardgaming on the computer. This is really just an excellent game. I can understand how important internal conflicts are and how the luck of drawing red tiles can be an issue, but that's minor to me. It's got a constrained decision space (only six tiles in your hand) but it's such a deep game.",42,Tigris & Euphrates
553073,andrewfoerster,9,"2  Just initially exploring this, and with just the premade decks, but it's a very fun, if somewhat complex, game of bluffing and gamesmanship.  There's certainly card draw luck, and there may not be quite so much bluffing on the Corp's side of things (advanced items will ... *frequently* ... be agendas), but it's very fun on both sides, whether trying to get the right ICE in place on the right servers, trying to plug all the leaks that come about, or as the Runner, getting a rig set up (see? I'm using game terminology!) with just the right breakers and cash to bust in on a server you think might have something.  The rules are terrible and make it really hard, I feel, to truly understand the flow and the various timing matters (when certain things can be rezzed or not).  Oh, wait, FFG.",124742,Android: Netrunner
612291,andrewfoerster,9,"1-4(2)  Okay, so there is plenty of rules complexity, like nearly every Vlaada game there are all sorts of idiosyncracies and some corner cases and etc. (you can attack marauding orcs from one square away, but you must siege a keep by moving onto it). The rulebooks remain, as is Vlaada's trademark, pretty difficult to use as a reference.  But, still, I loved it. It was a great game. I've only done the intro Recon mission, which didn't introduce many of the advanced elements and, though it introduced spells, we never managed to get any spells, so it did feel like a very curtailed version of the game.  Still, this is a fascinating deck-builder. Every player has a (very slightly) different deck and different abilities. It's great because it makes your game and your deck individual, but isn't as prone to horrible ""A Few Acres of Snow""-esque imbalance. There is a real, thematic flow to the game, and you actually do feel like you're doing what it says on the tin (exploring, fighting, and all that).  The basic action / enhanced (with mana) action deal is brilliant in combining a form of resource management with hand management. You actually feel like you can do something most every turn ... but just not quite enough. It's a really slick system.  The downsides are pretty apparent. The fiddliness is sometimes over the top: so, wait, when do I gain a reputation and when do I lose it? Oh, wait, can I even recruit this guy here? The rules, I reiterate, are tough to reference in-game. You don't get *quite* the same deck-building feel because (at least in the Recon mission) you cycle your deck so few times, meaning you get benefits from some cards only a few times. And then, everybody starts out with (nearly) the same deck and the opportunities to differentiate are sort of far in between (every other level you get a unique skill and advanced action) that it feels like you're playing similar games with just different draw orders.  Still, I'm being really critical. We had a lot of fun with this and time flew by while we were playing. This is top-shelf stuff and I'm eager to try it again.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game
618207,andrewfoerster,9,"2-4(2,3)  UPDATE: Yeah, it's a fun one. It's interesting, on account of every action feeling ""small"" and even redundant (many of the buildings do things you could do yourself ... though I guess with the benefit of filling your board) so it feels awfully slow-moving (likely why some thing it feels about 20 minutes too long), but there is that tangible progression. I'm enjoying this so far.  -------------------------------------------------------  You know, Stefan Feld gets a lot of crap for pasted-on themes and dry, soulless Euros, but I think he's a pretty clever designer. I'm a mechanics geek and each of his games pulls interesting mechanisms together in a fun way. I've never really been let down by his games: Notre Dame, Luna, Macao, and now Burgen. I was turned off when I played the PC version of In the Year of the Dragon, but now I'm tempted to see how it plays face-to-face.  dBvB is a clever game that limits your options with the dice, but has a very easy way to sort of manipulate things so that you can do what you want. There are a lot of things to remember (not building the same building in a ""city"" is a rule we missed, say) and it's hard to figure out the way to ""win"" but it's a great puzzle.",84876,The Castles of Burgundy

On the surface it looks so simple but pretty heavy strategy lies with since you have so many combination of card possibility.  Granted you will spend a lot to play competitive.  However, a lot of players are missing the point since this is also a Trading game and you can trade away stuff you don't need for stuff that helps your deck.  I was lucky in recognizing the new trend when it came out and jumped in immediately.  No other CCG plays as well as this game.",463,Magic: The Gathering
20144,andrewh63,10,Such a simple game but yet you have so many decisions.  I played this with my friend Lyman and immediately saw the potential for a great game.  I brought one copy to the gaming group and started the whole trend.  I ended up contacting a German MTG player who arranged to shipped about a dozen copies of the game plus the 5-6 expansion kit to our group.  This was before German game was avail in the US. I have one very beat up copy and one unopened copy.  Both of them are Kosmo(red box) edition.,13,Catan

Of course they can still screw you up with mod cards to make your monster encounter tougher.  Treasure card are either one shot bonus to combat or permanents.

Fairly easy to understand.  This time lot of interaction since you may have to use opponent owned property to do something.  More of a brain-burner than Agricola since you may have to change your strategy if someone else blocks it by their actions.

903626,andrewishi,7.5,"The game's strength is it's tactical level.  You'll try to use the actions you have available to you to move yourself towards your goal, maybe by riding on a conveyor belt or sitting on a turning platform to save a few actions.  You know which actions are going to execute in which order, so once you have your hand of actions, play is entirely determined by your decisions.  The exception to this, of course, is if one of the other players makes a move that affects your path.  If a bot ends the register (after each robot has executed that order, and after the terrain has triggered) facing another bot, it will be able to attack with a laser.  If a bot runs into another bot, it will be able to push the other bot, potentially throwing off the entire rest of the round for that player.  This is an interesting aspect, and the only thing that stops it from being a pure race, but whether or not you'll be a RoboBully or a RoboVictim comes down to whether you happen to start the round close to another bot (which usually happens incidentally, as ""Destroy all other bots"" isn't usually the goal), and whether you get closer to the cards you need than they do (which comes down to pure, dumb luck).",18,RoboRally

Plays fast and accommodates a range of numbers of players.  Great card quality, with cards being nearly full-art, but a weird size makes them harder to sleeve.  Has the unfortunate feature of being one of those games that really cares about how the group is seated when there are different skill levels.",68448,7 Wonders

936463,andrewleafman,9.5,"Twilight Struggle is a miracle of game design. It's one of the richest and most interesting strategy games ever and certainly the best two player game I've seen. The brilliant mechanics of hand management and DEFCON perfectly capture the feel of the Cold War. You feel like you're constantly fending off crises, which might not sound fun, but trust me--it is.   There are countless incredibly clever gameplay mechanics here. The scoring cards hidden in the deck with the rest of the cards--you are always paranoid your opponent might have one, and any aggressive play into a new region is taken as evidence. There's the way Europe stabilizes quickly and locks down into firmly entrenched battle-lines, so the conflict must spill out across the globe--just like the actual Cold War. In the Late War, the threat of Wargames amplifies the paranoia even further.   The asymmetry between the two powers adds quite a bit to the game's replayability. The US starts with more influence scattered across the board, but a good USSR player will seize the initiative in the early war and make more attacks than the US can possibly counter. Throughout the whole game, the USSR typically starts off each round with an aggressive coup. The USA can only hope to slow the Soviets down at first, but by the Mid War has a strong counterpunching ability. The USA benefits from better hand management options, too, and is at less risk of blundering into a nuclear war.   Some minor criticisms: first, the board doesn't stay flat properly. The game is a bit dependent on dice rolls--some ""war"" cards in particular feel too swingy. The game is slightly unbalanced in favor of the USSR, so that needs to be rectified by providing the US player 2-3 extra influence to start off. It's also true that knowledge of the cards is so essential that a newcomer, even one familiar with strategy games, will get killed by an experienced player 100% of the time.   Once both players know what they're doing, though, this is a blast.",12333,Twilight Struggle

My personal fav is 6 or 9. With its simple mechanics, it has incredible deduction/accusation logic under the hood. Each setup requires its own approach and modelling of all possible situations in advance. If you're a spy, you've got to plan your offensive and chaos-making strategies. If you're a good guy, you've got to predict spy behaviors, plan the tactics of keeping the group with a cold head. Either require strong emotional readiness for defensive situations.  P.S. Hidden Agenda (Avalon roles) are highly recommended.",41114,The Resistance

158374,AndrzejW,10,"Fast pretty and simple, with surprising depth.  I always wanted some ships as a collector but was really surprised how good the game is. My only gripe against it is bad (from gamer perspective) supporting card packaging. Cards that suplement your ships are most often in packages with completely different ships (good for company business bad for end users). But if you are non-tournament player just forget about the cards and print the rules from the net.  Its worth it.",103885,Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game

445743,Andy Mesa,9,It's amazing that despite 20 years this is still one of the best area control games. ,93,El Grande
471411,Andy Mesa,9, Ignacy's magnum opus. The only co-op game I truly enjoy.,121921,Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island
957856,Andy Mesa,7.5,The best bang for your buck in gaming. A fantastic and deceptively deep drafting game that appeals to everyone. ,133473,Sushi Go!

58914,Andy Pain,10,This is proving to be a popular choice as a game filler at club nights - I've yet to find someone who dislikes it,199561,Sagrada
60769,Andy Pain,10,"27 plays into the game it still feels fresh and rating up to 10. Now up to 46 plays and I've invested in acrylic overlays and cities. Still love this game. Number of plays now static at 93 due to expansions H&E played 31 times, colonies played 44 times. prelude played 20 Venus played 24 and Turmoil scores ongoing",167791,Terraforming Mars
71911,Andy Pain,10,Very good game it's simplicity to teach and learn means you can concentrate on actually playing the game and it zips along. My copy includes metal coins and character meeples,110327,Lords of Waterdeep
598659,Andy Pain,8,Played this two handed and it's a lovely little filler game.,65244,Forbidden Island
1031781,Andy Pain,8,"Played Tim's copy 3 handed - this is an easy to explain, easy to play, classic euro which quickly immerses you in the strategy rather than the rules. playing a high card to pick a special card comes at the expense of having more meeples to have available",93,El Grande
22723,Andy Parsons,10,"The deck of cards that drives this game is a brilliant piece of design.  It constantly presents the players with opportunities and tough decisions.  A long game, it ratchets up the tension and delivers swings of fortune to the last.  Twilight Struggle is an excellent combination of traditional wargame and Euro elements.   ",12333,Twilight Struggle
325841,Andy Parsons,9,My inability to draw the right tiles when I need them leaves this just short of gaming perfection for me.  Otherwise a deep and thoroughly enjoyable gaming experience.,42,Tigris & Euphrates
394987,Andy Parsons,8,"Perhaps still the best implementation of cooperative play.  By limiting communication it eliminates the puzzle-like feel that full knowledge brings to other designs.  The traitor adds terrifically to the game, although he is quite constrained in what he may do.  Very well themed too.  Concerns about play balance with the range of players and with and without the traitor take my rating down a notch.  ",15062,Shadows over Camelot
548380,Andy Parsons,9,"Transplant the mechanics of San Juan to a galaxy far far away and give the cards some excellent, sci-fi artwork.  Increase the number of different cards in a similar-sized deck from 29 to 95. Add a touch of complexity; all that variety does come at a price.  The result is a game whose possibilities I'll happily be exploring for quite a while.",28143,Race for the Galaxy
577510,Andy Parsons,9,"Like a very pared-down 18xx game.  Constant tensions between buying power stations, buildings and resources.  Engrossing.",2651,Power Grid
748823,Andy Parsons,8,"Rules-wise, Jaipur is simplicity itself.  It's a game of set collection, with the various commodities you are collecting worth different amounts.  There are also substantial bonuses for large sets.  The catch is that while you are clogging your hand with a single commodity, your nimble opponent may have sold several smaller sets and be speeding the round towards its conclusion.  He may even have sold some goods of the type you are collecting, to reduce your set's value.  A fine game.  Production quality is very good and the artwork is quite appealing.  The rules are a clear and easy read.",54043,Jaipur
791514,Andy Parsons,8,"The Resistance is a game modeled on Werewolf but with more information on which to base your deduction, no player elimination, and no need for a GM.  Which is all  good in my book. Avalon adds the Merlin character, who operates like the Seer and makes this version even more Werewolfy.  I have found both versions of The Resistance somewhat fragile.  If luck gifts one side an early advantage, it can be over quickly and unsatisfactorily.  On the other hand, it frequently delivers as concentrated a shot of bluff, deduction, paranoia and double-think as you can reasonably expect of a thirty-minute filler.  I rather liked the futuristic resistance cell setting of the original and this Arthurian re-theming makes somewhat less sense.  The art and production are both good.  The rules are clear enough.",128882,The Resistance: Avalon

49145,Andy Roid,10,"Very immersive game. Its more of a RPG than a boardgame. Great first adventure, ""the Asylum"" had two great puzzels. It´s the game that Mansions of Madness wanted to be like but never was.  You can never play the core box mission more than one time, when you solve it you have to move on to the next expansion mission. So I guess this game is a bit more expensive than a normal boardgame.  Can´wait to play the next mission, The Macy case. ",146508,T.I.M.E Stories

448975,AndyFi,9.5,"Race for the Galaxy is a very good game that turns into a Masterpiece when you include the expansions and start correctly. (Correct start w/ Expansions: each player dealt 1 red and 1 blue start world + 6 other cards - keep 4 cards and 1 start world).  Without expansions I rate the game ~8.  Nuances (not really negatives):   - The game has a steep initial learning curve.  - Many people take 5 to 10 games to explore and understand the main strategies.  - With expansions there are a lot of cards to become familiar with (and deal).   - Player interaction is predominantly tied to action selection.   Brilliance:   - No other game has as much strategic breadth, meaning that there are so many different ways to win.  - Plays great with 2 players or a group.  - Simultaneous player action selection keeps the game intriguing and fast paced.    - Balance of strategy (tied to start conditions) and tactics (tied to card drawing).    - So much variation that at 100+ games I'm still learning and exploring!",28143,Race for the Galaxy

I really like how T & E balances out with 3 players.  With 2 players, it seems that an early positional lead is tough to beat.  With 4 players I feel like the game ends a few turns too early.  Maybe my opinion will change, but for now I think I prefer 3 players for T & E.",42,Tigris & Euphrates

NOTE: http://theswitchingyard.com/monopoly.html has rule ideas to fix some of the games flaws.  It also highlights that most people don't play Monopoly by the actual rules.

At times I was so frustrated that I was virtually out of money and others had pots.  None of us had decent strategies worked out and in the end I came second due to two rounds were I built the most bits of tower.   Also don't be put off by the rules.  They seem needlessly complicated to me.  When you start playing it is pretty straightforward. ,18602,Caylus

358828,Andynosaure,9,"Great pieces, particularly the poker chips that are really nice to manipulate ! Splendor is a relatively short game with easy to learn mechanics.  Basically, you can take resources - 3 different ones or two of the same type - or buy a card which'll give you one virtual resource each turn. Doing so,you score victory points and begin to build your engine to buy cards granting more points, as they are more expensive resource-wise to get...  There are also noble guests to invite to your house, those VIPs only granting 3 victory points each. They'll come to visit you if you manage to get a certain number of cards giving you particular resources... Whenever a player reaches 15 points, the other players have one more turn to play. The player with the most victory points total wins the game.  The game is fluid, quick, tensed, but feels really different if you play with 2 or 4 players, the former being less chaotic than the later. I'll never turnaway from a Splendor game.

256917,AndysBloodbath,8.5,"A really nicely designed game that drips with the atmosphere of a spaghetti western in a cartoony fun way.  Each player is a bandit on a moving train that has a limited number of turns to steal as much loot as they can. The game plays a little bit like RoboRally in that you must program 4 or 5 moves for the next turn in advance, then let all your commands run their course... But in the reverse order from which you put them down.   The combat element is really nicely worked out so that you end up in wonderful situations where a group of bandits will be fist fighting over a bag of loot, or having a shoot-out accross carriages.  Getting shot doesn't mean you can ever die, but the wounds appear in your hand of command cards which can seriously limit your options for a turn.  All in all a very fun game game that is very easy to learn but can lead to noodle-scratching moments as you try to figure out how to best use the cards in your hand. The fact that you do the programming in reverse order only adds to the crazy fun bedlam. My only caveat is that I always feel as if it is over too quickly. Maybe that's just because I'm having fun :)",158899,Colt Express
267835,AndysBloodbath,9,"  A great game of planning and programming a robot in a race to checkpoints, the first robot to the last checkpoint wins.    Each player has 9 cards with move orders on them; Move forward, turn left, turn right, u-turn etc... They then select 5 cards that will be the robots next 5 actions, then watch it play out. Mistakes are made, robots crash and shoot each other, robots end up running around in circles due to a lack of move forward cards or are stuck on conveyer belts. Brilliant, silly fun, do yourself a favour and pick up a copy :D ",18,RoboRally
908040,AndysBloodbath,8,"A little gem of a game that's lighthearted and super easy to pick up and play. The idea of the game is to accumulate points by completing objectives. The objectives are in 3 categories; Bamboo growth, Panda bamboo consumption, and land hex arrangement. Land hexes and bamboo shoots are in 3 colours; pink, yellow and green.  Completing bamboo growth cards involves using a combination of rain and the farmer to make bamboo of particular colours to grow to certain heights. Completing panda bamboo consumption cards means moving the panda to where bamboo is growing and eating the shoots (See how these 2 types work for and against each other). Finally the land placement objectives are met by placing land hexes of particular colours into given arrangements in the play area.  The artwork is lovely and playful and the pieces are very well made. I would recommend this as a way to get kids involved in games or for involving girlfriends that aren't really into heavy duty strategy games.",70919,Takenoko

13268,AndySzy,10,"Wow. The card play is EXCELLENT. The branching storylines and RPGish campaign has me ready to keep playing every night. There is so much in this box.   Love the art, love the storyline, love how unpredictable things are. There were a few choices (city/road events) where we all looked at each other and said ""well, clearly the right answer is this one, right?"" and then got the rug pulled out from under us. Love it.  If I had to give some negatives: a) Some classes don't feel as fun as others - one player really didn't enjoy playing the Mindthief, for example. b) setup is a bear, and the rule that you shouldn't know whats coming in a room is hard to reconcile with trying to set up the board ahead of time c) first several missions are just variations on ""kill the things."" I'm looking forward to something with a different flavor.",174430,Gloomhaven

1035722,anemaat,9,"It would have been better if the natural flow of the game decides whether a country is a battleground or not. Of course you are a bit stuck to history, but couldn't Fidel appear in Mexico or Nasser in Israel, while maintaining a certain level of historical integrity. This would have made Twilight Struggle much less predictable, since you know from the beginning that Fidel will sooner or later appear in Cuba.   I also wished TS has some military units in it. So they could provide players with regional powerbases. And where are the hydrogyn and neutron bombs!?  I found the scoring mechanism too complex and not wholly sensible. For presence you only need to control one country. For the next level you need both the most normal and battleground countries. That is a too big leap. The scoring mechanism is also too rough and doesn't have the subtleties of Paths of Glory, from which I believe it is derived.  I also didn't like the way the Afghan and Vietnam War - Bear Trap and Quigmire cards - are handled.  However TS is a good and enjoyable game. A bit blant, perhaps a little bit simple and abstracted to me. There is nothing wrong with that, but the game doesn't really capture the spirit of the cold war.

4658,Anemelos,10,A excellent and thematic co-operative eurogame. I really enjoy this game. The theme and the mechanics blend so well. I love the fact that your decisions actually have consequences later in the game. A well developed game. Rulebook could be better though.    ,121921,Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island
33076,Anemelos,10,Awesome eurogame. So many choices. So many things to do. The game keeps throwing at you little decisions to make. What bonus tile you want? What favour you want? Will you trade 3 Victory Points for 4 Power?? No luck and hidden information. There is a lot of interaction for a euro. 14 different races to try out. Each one with unique abilities and playstyle. Great replayability. Variable setup helps too.  Reasonable playtime (almost 2 hours for 4 players) and good quality components. ,120677,Terra Mystica
151831,Anemelos,10,"Awesome card driven wargame(?). One of the best 2-player games. Creates a great atmosphere full of tension as you relive all the important world events.

396299,Anemelos,8,Great filler bidding game. Cute graphics. Awesome combination of bidding and bluffing. Easy to teach and play. It should be in every gamer's collection. One of the best fillers I have ever played. Highly recommented! ,172,For Sale
415948,Anemelos,9,Thoughts after a 5 players game:  Great area control game. I really liked the turn order bidding mechanic. There is a lot of tension and chaos because the action cards can really change the positions on the map. Turn order is crucial. The game lasts 9 turns and scoring happens after every 3 rounds.  The game feels very abstract and has the common problem of all area control games (bash the leader). I dont know if it plays equally well with any number of players.,93,El Grande
454359,Anemelos,9,"Excellent resource management euro game. Lots of interesting choices for the players. You have to construct buildings, take care of feeding your people, collect goods, built ships and 'manipulate' your resources. Many strategic paths to follow and it seems that there is always a back-up plan. Money can be tight. The rules are very easy to teach, gameplay is easy at first but things get more serious turn after turn.  Real brain-burner, love it. The special buildings provide some welcomed variety.

I really like how it manages to put you in the role of an investigator searching around, finding clues, fighting monsters, trying to find out what the hell is going on. Very thematic game and the campaign system helps in build tension and connecting with your character. Artwork is great too. I highly recommend this game to all Lovecraft's fans out there.   Comparing it to the Lord of the rings LCG, I think that the mechanics are more fine-tuned here. The campaign play is a big plus. The level up system is nice, The story of the first campaign is mediocre but later cycles have better story.",205637,Arkham Horror: The Card Game
569603,Anemelos,8,Nice little cooperative card game. The trick is that each player keeps their cards in a way that they are only visible to the others.

774058,Anemelos,8,"Ένα από τα πιο πολυσυζητημένα παιχνίδια της τελευταίας Έσσεν. Άκουγα εγκωμιαστικά σχόλια για το gameplay αλλά και έντονη κριτική για την έλλειψη replayability. Το παιχνίδι μου κίνησε το ενδιαφέρον και έπρεπε να το δοκιμάσω. Άλλωστε μου αρέσει να τσεκάρω τα συνεργατικά παιχνίδια. :p  Το βασικό κουτί περιέχει ένα μόνο σενάριο ενώ τα components και το ταμπλό είναι λιτά και λειτουργικά, σχεδιασμένα έτσι ώστε να μην αποσπούν την προσοχή σου από την καρδιά του παιχνιδιού που είναι οι κάρτες του σεναρίου. Οι παίκτες λοιπόν ταξιδεύουν στο χρόνο με σκοπό να αποτρέψουν διάφορα καταστροφικά γεγονότα. Η ιδέα του time travelling επιτρέπει στους σχεδιαστές να φτιάξουν σενάρια σε διάφορες χρονικές στιγμές τις ιστορίας. :)  Το παιχνίδι ακολουθεί την κλασσική adventurίστικη λογική εξερεύνησης τοποθεσιών. Βρίσκουμε αντικείμενα, συνομιλούμε με διάφορους χαρακτήρες, λύνουμε διάφορους γρίφους και ξεδιαλύνουμε έτσι σιγά σιγά την υπόθεση. Το σενάριο του βασικού παιχνιδιού εξελίσσεται το 1921 σε ένα ψυχιατρικό άσυλο και δημιουργεί μια ενδιαφέρουσα ατμόσφαιρα καθώς συνομιλούμε με διάφορους γιατρούς και ψυχασθενείς. Βοηθάει πολύ και το εξαιρετικό artwork. :)  Από άποψη μηχανισμών το TIME Stories δεν έχει να δείξει κάτι το ιδιαίτερο. Υπάρχουν διάφορα skill checks που θα συναντήσεις και ρίχνεις ζάρια ανάλογα με τα στατιστικά του ήρωα σου. Το παιχνίδι σου δίνει ένα συγκεκριμένο χρονικό περιθώριο για να λύσεις την υπόθεση. Μετά επιστρέφεις υποτίθεται στην βάση και σε ξαναστέλνουν πίσω για να ξαναδοκιμάσεις. Το παιχνίδι κάνει ουσιαστικά reset αλλά πλέον ξέρεις αρκετά πράματα και δεν χάνεις χρόνο κάνοντας ανούσιες κινήσεις.   Βρήκα επίσης ενδιαφέρον το γεγονός πως όταν πας να μιλήσεις με κάποιον χαρακτήρα δεν διαβάζεις την κάρτα φωναχτά σε όλους αλλά αντιθέτως την αφήνεις πίσω στη θέση της και μετά περιγράφεις στους συμπαίχτες σου το τι έγινε. Όπως ακριβώς δηλαδή θα γινόταν και στην πραγματικότητα. Μπορεί να ακούγεται κλάιν μάιν αλλά πάιζει το ρόλο του. Καμιά φορά κάποιος μπορεί να μην προσέξει μια λεπτομέρεια σε μια  κάρτα οπότε συνιστώ στα επόμενα reset του παιχνιδιού να αλλάζεται το ποιος πάει σε κάθε σημείο ώστε και άλλοι παίκτες να τσεκάρουν τι γίνεται.  Γενικά το παιχνίδι προσφέρει μια πολύ όμορφη εμπειρία και συνιστώ σε όλους τους φαν της κατηγορίας να το δοκιμάσουν. Το story σε κρατά σε εγρήγορση και θέλεις να βρεις τι κρύβεται από πίσω. :ninja: Είναι πολύ απλό από άποψη κανόνων και μπορεί να παιχθεί και από casual παίκτες αρκεί να γνωρίζουν καλά αγγλικά γιατί υπάρχει αρκετό κείμενο. Από την άλλη οι hardcore gamers ας μην περιμένουν πολύπλοκους μηχανισμούς και πληθώρα στρατηγικών αποφάσεων. Το παιχνίδι είναι περισσότερο σαν μια ταινία.   Το πρόβλημα όμως είναι πως άπαξ και λύσεις το σενάριο μετά δεν έχει και πολύ νόημα να ξαναπαίξεις αφού θα ξέρεις ακριβώς τα βήματα που πρέπει να ακολουθήσεις. Πρέπει να αγοράσεις νέα σενάρια. Το αν αξίζει τελικά τα λεφτά του είναι καθαρά προσωπικό και υποκειμενικό ζήτημα. Πχ για να πάμε σε ένα escape room (που είναι και της μόδας εδώ στη Σαλονίκη :p) 4 άτομα δίνουμε 10 ευρώ έκαστος για μια εμπειρία 1 ώρας. Με τα 40 ευρώ μπορείτε να πάρετε το παιχνίδι που σας προσφέρει μια αντίστοιχη εμπειρία και σας μένει το παιχνίδι.   Ωραίο story driven παιχνίδι φτιαγμένο έτσι ώστε να μπορεί να υποστηρίξει πλήθος διαφορετικών σεναρίων. Περάσαμε υπέροχα. Περιμένουμε το επόμενο σενάριο. :whistle: ",146508,T.I.M.E Stories

1022496,Anemelos,8,"Great looking miniatures. Simple rules, fast paced gameplay. I am afraid that the core set is not enough to fully appreciate the game. I also find unacceptable that the core set doesn't come with enough dice. Come on FFG!   Επιτραπέζιο παιχνίδι με μινιατούρες από την Fantasy Flight Games στο στυλ του κλασσικού Wings of War. Αρχικά να πω πως οι μινιατούρες είναι prepainted και φαίνεται να είναι καλής ποιότητας και πιστά αντίγραφα των σκαφών αν και δεν είμαι ειδικός επί του θέματος.   Οι κανόνες είναι πολύ απλοί και λειτουργικοί. Ο κάθε παίκτης διαλέγει ταυτόχρονα και κρυφά τι κίνηση θέλει να κάνει το κάθε σκάφος του. Μετά με την σειρά το κάθε σκάφος κινείτε χρησιμοποιώντας το αντίστοιχο template (ξεχάστε hexes και μεζούρες) και επιλέγει ένα action. Αφού κινηθούν όλα τα σκάφη μετά αρχίζει η μάχη και ρίχνουμε τα ζάρια.   Στο ταμπλό μπορούμε να τοποθετήσουμε και μετεωρίτες για εμπόδια, ενώ τα σκάφη είναι κάπως παραμετροποιήσημα αφού μπορούμε να επιλέξουμε τον εξοπλισμό που θα φέρουν. Σκοπός είναι να καταρρίψεις όλα τα αντίπαλα σκάφη αλλά υπάρχουν στους κανόνες και 2-3 σενάρια με διαφορετικά objectives.  Μου άρεσε που το παιχνίδι έχει γρήγορο ρυθμό και καταφέρνει να σου περάσει την αίσθηση του να πιλοτάρεις ένα σκάφος. Είναι πολύ διασκεδαστικό και αν έχεις περισσότερα σκάφη τότε μπορείς εύκολα να παίξεις και με περισσότερους από 2 παίκτες. Το μόνο αρνητικό είναι πως το βασικό σετ είναι περισσότερο σαν demo του πραγματικού παιχνιδιού. Για να φτιάξεις ένα πραγματικό στόλο χρειάζεται να πάρεις 2-3 ακόμα σκάφη. Παράλληλα θα ανοίξουν και οι επιλογές από κάρτες εξοπλισμού.  Όμορφο, απλό, γρήγορο, και εθιστικό. Δεν ξέρω όμως πόσες παρτίδες θα σας βγάλει το βασικό σετ προτού χρειαστείτε το κάτι παραπάνω.",103885,Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game

Σκοπός είναι να γεμίσεις όσο πιο πολύ μπορείς το ταμπλό σου, ενώ ρόλο παίζει το turn order και το πότε θα ενεργοποιήσεις το εισόδημα σου. Το κάθε σχήμα στα tiles είναι μοναδικό.  Η αλληλεπίδραση όπως και στα περισσότερα eurogames περιορίζεται στο ποιος παίκτης θα προλάβει το τάδε tile, ενώ υπάρχουν και κάποια μικρά tiles δώρο σε όποιον τρέξει στο turn order, που μπαλώνουν τρύπες στο ταμπλό σου. Τίμιο παιχνίδι, συνιστάται σε όσους αρέσκονται στο tile placement.

788424,anerien,8,"At first I was a bit skeptical about the quality of this game because the components are not the greatest quality. However, with up to 50 different possible story lines, it ended up being a really enjoyable game. Since you don't know who the traitor will be, what the end game is, or even what order the rooms will appear, there is a lot of anticipation at the beginning. Sometimes the game can seem broken because the specific end game will give an extreme advantage to the traitor or the investigators. For example, If the goal to win turned out to be ""escape the house"" and the investigators are only two or three squares from the front door, and the traitor is on the second floor of the house 10 tiles away, then there isn't even a chance the traitor can win, but hey, then you can just reset the board and play again! I was also worried because it was aimed at 3 or more people and I typically play 2 player games. However, since you don't know who the traitor will be, and can't really prepare for it, each person takes two investigators and then when the traitor is revealed, they can give their other investigator to the other player and it doesn't really ruin anything. Its not the style of game where you can ""sup up"" a character to prepare for the end game. ",10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill

Plays quick enough that it's possible to get played reasonably often. Really like it, hope to play for a long time to come-- and I am just starting to try out the alien races.",72125,Eclipse
22083,angelgabriel,10,What can I say? I never tire of this marvellous game. Works brilliantly with 2-4. The only problem is that the learning curve to introduce new players is quite steep.,28143,Race for the Galaxy
50469,angelgabriel,10,"Fantastic game, wonderful sense of building up one's own farm, with just enough player interaction, chiefly through worker placement blocking other players. The cards give enough variety to make every game interesting: you can plan a strategy at the beginning (and throughout) but you also have to make a lot of tactical decisions when your plans don't work out. Very tight, works well for all player counts.  I like the FOTM expansion for variety (and more to think about!), but I still like the game without the expansion as well.",31260,Agricola

38956,angler,10,Okay - this one is huge on BGG right now and moving up the ranks quick. I was super excited about and couldn't wait to get it to the table. Granted I am still in the glow that results after the first play of something I liked but this game fired on all cylinders for me. We hooked up a blue tooth speaker on the table for ambiance and my wife and I adventured away. We actually lost the first scenario as wife's investigator went insane right at the end. Can't wait to play again. ,205059,Mansions of Madness: Second Edition
370493,angler,9,"Me likey! It's funny to me that in many reviews I read and watch for ""zombie"" games many people state they don't care for the zombie genre. It's almost like it's ""cool"" to not like zombies. :) I am the opposite. Love the theme and this game does a great job with it. The majority of the focus is on the survivors, not the zombies so zombie haters... don't be scared off. ",150376,Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game
383192,angler,9,Rated a 9 after 2 plays in with the wife. First game we easily won (with only a few errors) and the 2nd game we were spanked so hard it was comical. Have already set up a game night to teach the buddies. ,146021,Eldritch Horror

480194,angler,9,"I love this game. I am the kind of person that likes to put some themed music on in the back ground and get into the spirit of it. Here's the funny part. I have only played once but it was stretched over a couple of days as my wife and I were taking our time learning. Knew I would like it enough to expand so have already purchased 3 big box expansions. Again, looking forward to teaching the game group.  (Update)Played two games back to back with a buddy. 2nd one was 2-3 hours long. Really makes a difference once you have a good understanding of all the rules. two thumbs up! (Update 2) Have a few games under the belt now and it's definitly a crowd pleaser",15987,Arkham Horror
563829,angler,9,My first LCG. Great story and theme which are important to me. Had fun learning it tonight with the wife. ,205637,Arkham Horror: The Card Game
570676,angler,9,My game group loves this game and so do I. It helps that all of us have been friends for years and we have strong personalities that enable us totally mislead each other. Just when you think you know somebody... play this game and have them reveal after you have been allied with them all night. Even my wife pulled the wool over my eyes. Outstanding!!,37111,Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game
891861,angler,8,Awesome in it's simplicity. First time played was 4 games in a row. Both me and my friend loved it. A great two player adventure. ,10630,Memoir '44

438677,AngryHank,10,"I have only owned Scythe for a couple weeks now but have somehow managed to convince people to play it with me roughly 8 times already. I have played with 1-4 players so far, played with each character and action card at lead once, and have taught the game several times now. Here's what you need to know: There is little to no ""chance"" in this game. Other than the randomization in setting up the game (which is optional), the only luck is in some of the card draws (combat cards, encounter cards, factory cards) and even those will certainly not determine your fate. Ultimately this game comes down to strategy and a better player with a better strategy wins. The solo mode is awesome. It works extremely well and, once learned, can be fast paced, challenging, and novel each time it is played. The autonoma is not crazy and unpredictable, but rather follows a general strategy consisting of building up, then crossing the rivers, then moving in the direction of the factory and you, and then getting aggressive real fast. While it may seem as though having a general pattern like this would cause repetitive gameplay, it doesn't; it simply makes the autonoma more like a smart strategic player who does what he needs to do to win and keeps the pressure on you to play well or play dead. Explaining the game is surprisingly easy, though admittedly an involved process. All of the gameplay in Scythe thematic, meaning that nothing in the game exists just to make the game function, it all legitimately fits with the theme well. This results in much of the mechanics being very intuitive and memorable because it makes sense that it would be that way in real life. Though the game is intensely strategic, I have found that non-game-geeks can actually really enjoy it. Several people I have played with have finished the game with a comment like ""I usually can't sit down and play a game like this for more than 20 minutes without getting bored out of my mind, but this was actually really fun!""  It doesn't have to take 2 hours. In fact, only one of my playthroughs thus far has exceeded and hour and a half (not including explanation) and that was a 4 player game with 2 new players and everyone was a game geek. Most of my playthroughs have taken around an hour, and probably could have been shorter if people knew the game well. You can really decide the speed of the game by how aggressively you play; if you just push to get stars as quickly as possible, it is conceivable that the game would end in 45 mins. Overall, the game has been nothing but a good time so far and a great challenge. I look forward to many more plays and I will very likely buy the expansions before too long.",169786,Scythe

I have yet to get this one in front of my regular group, but I have played a few 2 player games.  2 player is decent, but I think Eclipse will shine with 4-6 players.  The population cubes and influence discs are a super elegant way to keep track of how your empire is growing.  Hex based exploration is basically the only way to do it right.  I love the ship customization aspects as well.  The two things I don't care for have super easy fixes.  One, the cubes get knocked around too easily.  I've already purchased some acryllic cube holders that solve that issue.  Two, I hate the ships!  I think they don't look all that great.  This might get fixed as well, since I think the developer is working on some kind of 'bonus pack' or something with alternate ships to use.",72125,Eclipse

I've made a custom set with a Star Wars theme in hopes of luring her into playing.  Wonderful game.  Update:Still no luck with the wife but a coworker is as enamored with this game as I am and we get a session or two quite frequently.  A great portable game that is Deep, Deep, Deep. ",2655,Hive
207640,AngusBull,8.58,Excellent quick auction game IMO.  Quick game play and tense moments during the second phase while everyone reveals their cards makes this one a great filler or lunch game with three or more.,172,For Sale

I hope AH sees fit to release the expansions since they included some of the boards in the course layouts in the manual.,18,RoboRally
448274,AngusBull,9.56,Love it!!!  The fluctuating commodities market. The auctions. The empire building (sort of).  This game is a true favorite of mine.  I've just pushed it higher after some additional plays.,2651,Power Grid
538475,AngusBull,9.08,Rating after several plays ranging from two to four players.  Excellent if you like complex games or game elements.  This one is prone to forgetting to activate powers on cards on the table that you've played if you're not careful.  Works very well two player and the variety in the deck and numerous paths to victory make this one have wonderful replability.  Haven't tried with the wife yet but she may prefer to play San Juan over Race.  I presonally prefer the complexity of Race.,28143,Race for the Galaxy
594773,AngusBull,8.62,"After my first game I though ""Meh, maybe a 6 - 6.5""  but I waited to reat it.  Additional plays really brought this one up in my esteem.  It take a few plays to really understand the beauty of this area majority game and I find myself liking it more with each play.  Currently 8.73.  If the rating changes for the better or worse it will be noted here. ",93,El Grande
792741,AngusBull,8.1,Excellent game that I wish I could play more but it's depth and abstract nature seems to be beyond the casual gamers that currently make up my gaming circle.  At least BGG gives me an outlet for playing this one!,42,Tigris & Euphrates

I think the mechanics scratch many itches. I really enjoyed the battle with dice; perhaps for the nostalgia of playing Risk, but the fact that you can upgrade your ships and increase your odds is awesome. Great fun, great game! It is the first long game that my husband asked to play again right away, despite the fact that it was 1am already.  For now, my rating is based on my first 2 plays which were 2 player games. I wonder if it will be just as good with more. I suspect it will be better.",72125,Eclipse

914478,anij,9.5,"Fantastic game! I really enjoy the sense of urgency you get while trying to balance out all your options. I love that it can be played solo. I also love that when my 9 year old daughter and I play together, we can play to beat our old scores rather than against each other. I think this is one of the few games that play very well with many different people and situations.  About the components, at first I thought I would run out and get the animeeples and such, but in reality I have no problems with cubes and discs and find my imagination goes a long way. So much so that often use cattle to power my power plants! :) (May 2012) Rating went down an 8.5 instead of 9.5 after playing a 5 player game. It was ok but seemed to take too long. I still enjoy a 2 player game, but after playing Eclipse I realize I like to have more interaction in my games. (Nov. 2013) Back to 9.5! I've been playing with my husband a lot more lately.

191494,anjentai,10,"You would think that I've managed to play this game by now, given 1) I've owned a copy since it debuted in 2005, and 2) it's the #1 game on geek.  But until yesterday (8/11/2011), I had not bothered to punch the counters.  What can I say, this is an awesome game! It is more fiddly in execution than a heavy Euro, but not much more complicated.  In fact, I would say it is easier to learn and teach than Agricola.  It is clear to me, even on 1 play that it is a very deep game and the mechanics are beyond clever.  It is as close to a a perfect combination of simplicity of play and richness of theme.  Simply brilliant.",12333,Twilight Struggle
315006,anjentai,9.5,"Finally got a chance to try Eclipse last week and it was worth the wait.  Other than the fact that it is not historical, in terms of both theme and mechanics, it has virtually everything that I find compelling in a strategic game.  Technology ladder, grand scope, economic engine, strategic and tactical play, risk taking, direct but muted conflict (and thus a nearly ideal amount of player interaction from my POV).  Of the games I've played in the last 2 years, the only one that exceeds it is Dominant Species and that might just because I know the game better.  There are a lot of moving parts, but the mechanics are very intuitive and other than keeping track of and remembering the technologies (which would not have been a problem if we had a cheat sheet available), the game is remarkably easy to pick up.",72125,Eclipse

768361,anjentai,8,"Played this old favorite for the first time in many years.  I had forgotten what a great game this was.  The theme, as all Kinizia games tend to be, is a bit thin, but it might be the most elegant game in my collection, where elegance is defined as simplicity in design/mechanic and depth in both tactical and strategic decision making.  ",50,Lost Cities
879327,anjentai,8.5,"Definitely an interesting twist on worker placement.  Not immediately clear to me whether the standard expand your number of workers as quickly as possible strategy is dominant.  It is both more difficult to accomplish in this game than in others, and the payoff is a little less clear as well.  Must resist urge to check out the strategy forum on BGG!",126163,Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar
926834,anjentai,9,"Now that I've got two plays under my belt, it will be interesting to see if I continue to learn much strategy wise.  I'm not going to read the strategy articles, at least for a while, but based on my limited experience the keys to winning in order seem to be:  1. Fully understand the advantages and disadvantages of your character and how that impacts what you develop and where on the map you need to focus  2. Integrate the end of turn bonuses into your overall strategy.  You don't want to go completely out of your way, but it is a very important source of victory points that many players ignore.  I believe the ability to manage this properly is often the difference in games that involve experienced players.  3. Grab the bonus wish tiles for settlements and trading posts as early as possible. There may be characters for which this is problematic, but I have a hard time seeing somebody winning without one or both of these bonuses by the end of turn 3.  4. Don't worry too much about the end of game bonuses for connections and temples until the last turn or two.  Earlier in the game there is usually better things to do, and you don't want to get in a pissing match trying to get the lead.    5.  Getting a third town is nice, but I think it is sufficiently tricky that you are almost always better off doing something else less risky.  ",120677,Terra Mystica

The mix of mechanics among the different districts adds a sort of carnival-like charm to the game were players gamble here, move a little sliding cube shop thing over there, cash in on an unlikely layout of goods at that place, cashing in all your coins for a gem at this other place, upgrading the carts, snatching cards......etc.  The randomization of tiles each game adds to the variability from game to game, completely shifting the viable strategies at times. At others, the cards that you draw can produce hilarious combos that make you glad that you didn't waste it earlier in the game doing some stupid little thing.

There is an obvious need for contingency plans in case you mistime the gear movement and your strategy fizzles. Stockpiling corn is comforting as without this precious resource, your chosen strategy will collapse. It seems clear that you can't do everything, but there is great fun in trying!

The irony of this excess is that players ask themselves simple questions. What would I like to do next? What must I do now? There are no easy solutions and I love that! This game imposes a difficult, but brilliant dilemma: grow your family so you can complete more actions, but expand too soon and it will be hard to feed them.

Végtelen számú kombinációs lehetőség, komoly stratégia jellemzik. Újabb és újabb partik szükségesek ahhoz, hogy igazi mélységét megtapasztaljuk. Vannak akik szerint túlságosan magas a szerencse szerepe a játékban (lapkahúzás a zsákból - vannak akik ezt a zsákból húzást is egy ovis módszernek tartják), de szerintem nem vészes. A változatos, kiszámíthatatlan játékhoz ennyi kell. Nem nevezhető gyors játéknak. Sőt, ""gondolkodós"" játékosokkal nagyon hosszúra is nyúlhat. Hármasban a legjobb, de szerintem ketten és négyen is jól játszható.",42,Tigris & Euphrates

I grew up in a big family where we loved listening to my grandmother tell us scary stories and playing this game brings back that feeling.   The replay value is huge. We have the base game and the new expansion and we haven't played through all of the scenarios in either. Even if you replay a scenario you will still get something new out of it.   I will play this game with anyone at anytime!,10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill

Such an incredible mix of the original Pandemic mechanisms meshed into an ongoing campaign that really builds the tension and delivers an amazing narrative, filled with stress, tension and a roller-coaster of competing decisions.  Although I must say it is agonising tearing-up cards.  I can't wait to see what happens next - so exciting.",161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1

Easy to learn, with a short playtime.of around 45 mins.  Only enhanced by the ""On the Brink"" expansion, which adds more roles and even greater challenges.  A must buy!",30549,Pandemic
13580,anomander64,10,"Simple, quick, easy to play, great mix of luck and some tactics.  My only gripe is that the cards are too large.  Normal sized cards would make the came a 10 in my book.  This is a really fun two-player game where you can be really nasty.  We often play it at a blinding speed, which adds lots to the enjoyment, where you only have seconds to make a decision.  I particularly love the scoring mechanism, so clever.  Highly recommended.",50,Lost Cities
38394,anomander64,9,"This is a seriously underrated game.  I really, really like this game and so does the family and friends.  A real rarity, able to scale between 3-10 players easily.  Kind of a co-op/non-co-op game.  Great theme that fist perfectly, dwarves digging for gold, and someone gets to be the saboteur.  A fun little game with quite a bit of interaction.  Highly recommended for parties.",9220,Saboteur
78580,anomander64,9,"Another light, filler game, but this involves a really nice level of bluffing and trying to outguess your opponents.  Always goes down well with family, friends, workmates and newbies.  Highly recommended.  An almost perfect gateway filler game.",172,For Sale
216838,anomander64,9,"This is one of the great 2-player abstract games.  The elegance of design and simplicity of the rules, makes it a wonderful tussle just as it is.  But add onto this the astounding production from Roxley including the fantastic island and buildings, plus gorgeous artwork from Mr Cuddington, PLUS all the different god powers which dramatically adds variability and replayability - and all delivered in just 15-20 mins.  As a package, it is truly phenomenal.",194655,Santorini
265088,anomander64,9,"The Resistance is one of my favourite games and Avalon is even better, with nicer components, gorgeous artwork and some interesting options and twists with Merlin and the Assassin adding extra tension.  For those not familiar with The Resistance, Avalon is a social deduction game where players assume secret identities competing as teams to either cause missions to succeed or fail.  The best 3 of 5 wins for the particular side.    Deceptively simple on the surface, easy to setup and a breeze to learn, the real fun comes from the player interaction involving accusations and bluffing as each person tries (with very limited information) to determine who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.  Works best in a group willing to ""talk it up"" and I guarantee you'll spend twice as long afterwards laughing and dissecting the tactics and accusations.  Small, cheap with a play-time of around 15-20 mins (depending on group chatter), it covers groups from 5-10 players with no player elimination.  Avalon is a hands down winner and one of those rare games that is as near to perfect as I can find.",128882,The Resistance: Avalon
269701,anomander64,9,"A delightfully simple game, particularly considering how it makes use of only 16 cards.  The aim is to eliminate the other players and be the last man standing with the highest value card, played super-fast across several rounds.  Combine bluffing, deduction, a modest amount of strategy and quite a bit of luck, and you have a quick, light, and easily accessible filler that is highly portable and loads of fun.  While I own the original I also have a pimped ""Princess Bride"" version that is a joy to play, as the characters so nicely match the roles.",129622,Love Letter
280725,anomander64,8,"The clever mechanisms used in Pandemic have been melded into a much lighter, quicker and more accessible game for kids and families.  Whilst I really enjoy this game, it doesn't have the same intensity I gain from Pandemic.",65244,Forbidden Island
286400,anomander64,8,"Based on many of the comments I expected this game to be a disappointment and a replica of Forbidden Island, but I was pleasantly surprised.  While the game has a number of similarities to Forbidden Island, it also has enough to differentiate it.  I particularly liked the hidden treasure aspect and the innovative way the treasure moves around as the sandstorm blankets the map.  Thematically, you do feel exposed and frustrated as the sun beats down and you race to find the treasure before your water supply runs out.  In many ways, I feel Forbidden Desert is a better game overall, but a few more plays will tell.  Either way, it is definitely enjoyable, tense and very accessible for non-gamers.",136063,Forbidden Desert

Simple mechanism where players roll dice and bash the hell out of each other, but it's not all bashing.  You need to balance your health and victory points, gain energy, which allows you to buy power-up cards to affect play.  Fabulous cartoony artwork underpins a light, tactical luck fest that is simply lots and lots of fun.  Quick to learn and play, in around 20-30 mins.  Works best with 5-6 players, not so good with 2.",70323,King of Tokyo
889091,anomander64,8,"Simply superb!  Over 60 plays...  Adds so much dimension to the original.  Probably not quite as easily accessible for new players, but for those familiar with Dominion already, this is just the ticket.  So many more options available and decisions to make.  The game really feels a lot more interactive.  The fact that you can mix and match with the base set offers even wider possibilities and many, many more enjoyable games.  Dominion itself has been an enormous hit with all my friends, and Intrigue is proving it's worth even more so.  If you like Dominion, I would heartily recommend Intrigue, as it adds so much extra flavour and extensibility to the original game.    A definite 11 out of 10 for me.",40834,Dominion: Intrigue

UPDATE: I no longer feel that the dice play too much of a factor.  The beauty of Stone Age is the degree to which you can mitigate the luck involved with respect to the dice.  Build a huge population so you don't have to worry about crappy rolls, or invest in tools to accomplish the same effect.  This is actually one of my favorite two player games.",34635,Stone Age

UPDATE (05/10/2014): In my view, this will prove to be another Richard Garfield classic, right up there with Magic: The Gathering and RoboRally.  If you have kids, you can't go wrong here.

We were off and running in no time, as the rules are very clear and there are only four pages of them (in addition to a set-up cheat sheet).  There are some unique mechanics in play, and the randomized tile setup at the beginning will enhance the replayability of the game.  I am becoming more and more of a Mac Gerdts fan.  I also own and really like The Princes of Machu Picchu, which also employs some unique mechanics.  I can't wait to get this back to the table...  UPDATE (03/13/2019): Well, I got it back to the table, this time with three players instead of two.  It seemed to drag on for a lot longer than the two-player game.  Granted, I was playing with my kids, it still seemed to be exorbitantly longer.  I'm downgrading it a tick for how long it lasts, which I think is just a tad bit too long.

I understand and agree that player decisions are rarely informed (though they do have an impact) but the game's ability to tell a story and depict a world on the edge of destruction is unparalleled. Writing this is making me want to go play it now.  2019-02 Update: I still love this game like none other. I have spent a good amount of money blinging it up. Still wouldn't mind printing the game boards on neoprene.  2020-04: Still a ten for me. I have almost never had a bad game of this. My passion for it is starting to wane slightly, but I still will play this on request.",146021,Eldritch Horror

It would not be a filler for people that cannot quote the rules of stack from Magic like it was scripture, but for those of us who can, very light and perfect. I want new factions though. Badly. The idea that as shipped, all factions are represented in a four player game rubs me wrong way. Bring on Ninja Bears!  2019-05 Update: I still love this game, though I don't get to play it as much as I wish to. I think this is one of the better simple games to hook new people to the hobby. In that regard it destroys older games for the function like Munchkin. If it had been around when I first started playing games it would be one of my most played games of all time.",122522,Smash Up

454451,AnotherHorrorFan,9.5,"A masterpiece. Very likely to become my favorite card game of all time as it expands. This is what I so desperately wanted the LOTR LCG to be even though I couldn't articulate what it was I was needing. Building a deck feels more like building a character than a collection of cards and the story lines are engrossing, interesting, and have enough internal variability to warrant multiple plays. I suspect I will be playing this one for years and I can't wait.  2019-02 Update: Adjusted the score because the game is not perfect, but it is close. Played through the first campaign with Jo last year. A ton of fun. An unbelievable design that I have a metric ton of content for if we ever have the time to play it.  2020-04: Phenomenal game.

I have now played this game quite a bit and I don't think I have ever had a non-stellar game. Any hidden role game that causes me to turn to a team mate as soon as its over and say ""I'm Merlin dumb***"" is aces in my book.  2019-05 Update: I played this game a billion times at EA and then decided I wouldn't play it for a long time. I pretty much just remembered it exists. It deserves a resurrection. ",128882,The Resistance: Avalon

Running around the train trying to beat each other up is a lot of fun. I just wish the characters were a bit more balanced.  2019-02 Update: I feel like this game gets a bum rap in my memories. The game is a lot of fun for what it is, but I just don't have a lot of love for programmed action games.  2020-04: My appreciation for this game has been fairly static, which may be a testament to the uniqueness of the gameplay and theme. I had almost gotten rid of it a few years back too, and the recipient didn't want to take it because they knew I would regret it. Prophetic. ",158899,Colt Express

As a person who tends to get too competitive with party games, Dixit is somehow very disarming for me. I really love every minute that I spend playing this game, and will now commence scrambling for expansions to mix the game up a bit.  2019-02 Update: Still love it. Makes a better activity than a game though.   2020-04: It is amazing how much this game comes up still in conversation. I don't find the game that engaging, but it is a great activity, and has served as the leap off point for many other great games.",39856,Dixit

It has diversity, every game is unique, it is really balanced - all 5 players finished withing 30 VP of each other and the winner was not clear until the very end.

A good card draw gives a player better chances of winning, bad die rolls can destroy one's strategy.  After 3 plays: I like the game more and more, it shows quite some depth that I could not see in the first play. It is not a 10 just because an unlucky draw can leave you without a strategy. If your opponent will have throughout the game all or most of the scoring cards and he/she plays well, than you stand almost no chance.

The game end and victory condition is refreshingly different than what’s usually expected in these kinds of games. The game end can be AP prone since everyone is trying to find a way to finish the game. The game works better with 4 than 5 players, especially if the starting place is in the corner. In a 5-player game it can be that the last player has to follow a path someone else is already choosing and he has to donate his starting money to the other player. This problem could have been nicely solved by giving one more coin for each player in the beginning. This way the fifth player would have 7 coins and he could pursuit for the extra storage right in the beginning.",148949,Istanbul

113878,Antiquus,10,"Actually: rise from 8 to 10 after 6 more games played... is simply amazing and leave a good feeling to all people after playing it. The game is complex so you need few plays to exploit all its possibilities but now is one of the most satisfying games, a game you want to be participant the very next time will be set up :)  First Impressions: Only played twice... was very hard to win as humans and this made the victory extremely sweet. People in my group consider it too complex and prefer Shadow over Camelot :P",37111,Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game
125687,Antiquus,10,"An excellent fantasy RPG board game. A short and concise rulebook is needed because you get lost in the actual ones when search for details. This game provide good complexity and great strategies but with the cost of many hours spent. Is not so easy to learn and have many exceptions hard to find in rulebook... searching will eat time too, but when learned to be played offer many satisfactions and good feeling.  Conclusion: need 10-20 games to learn to play it well and without time dragging. Rating goes from 9.5 - 9.6 up to full 10 after only 8 plays! In fact the only regret is that it don't play a bit faster and this keep this wonderful game out of the table considering that few friends have so much time to spend with a single game session. Play best with 1-3 players.   Best style of play: competitive without PvP. Is the kind of game you'll love more with the every new session of play. And if you keep it away a while you'll miss not playing it.  Plays status with expansion included:  - starting scenario with 5 players - 6+ hours - played in 2 and 3 players a blitz conquest and game took around 4-6 hours. - full conquest (2players) - 6+hours - played mines liberation (2 players) - 5+hours - played dungeon lords scenarios (2players) -6+ hours(Obs.: a blitz variant work if you exclude all non-dungeons,village,monasteries green tiles and you put red enemies only on core tiles secret tombs, brown on countryside tiles even near monasteries or you'll have to fight red monsters at the start of the game)   Is nice that you have variety in choosing from few different kind of scenarios with different goals.  Amazing experience! Is a game that you'll dream playing if you don't play it. Have somehow the feeling of Heroes of Might&Magic or King's Bounty on a board.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game

I owe so much to this game that I can honestly say it changed my life, not something you can say often about anything.   The deckbulding is deep (albeit a bit killed by the internetas far as i'm concerned), limited play requires so much skill and the actual playing requires another set of skills. A fantastic game that I regret pratically not playing any longer due to a lack of time for the investment it requires.  Hours dicussing picks in a draft, slot in a deck or a card potential in general, good times.  I turned to the boardgames to replace it when I no longer had the time to play it (oddly enough it coincides with the arrival of the children, maybe there's a link?).  Forever special to me.

99412,AntonG,10,"PROS:  - A simple and yet entertaining game system.  - The games are exciting and fast-paced. The game length is moving at around 25-45 minutes.  - Very cleverly elaborated topic.  - Variable difficulty.  - It is necessary to cooperate.  - Fun and playable in even 2 or more players. Solo play is also possible (the player will play several characters).   - Entertaining even after many games.  - It can take a rare players as well as experienced players. Quickly explaination of rules.  - Some game material is somewhat minimalist (wooden cubes and classic wooden figures), but for this game it fits. - Sympathetic size of box and the board (game does not need much space).  - The influence of chance is adequate for gameplay, fun and thrill of the game.  - Set up of the game is quite fast.   CONS: - Dominant players can theoretically take the reins of the game (but it never happened in our case).  - Some cities on the map are shown somewhat confusingly (mainly in Asia), so sometimes the site is looking a while.  - Some of characters are more powerful than the others.  CONCLUSION: Best cooperative boardgame I've ever played. A brisk, exciting (sometimes it's really adrenalin), fun... and yet rules can be explained in a few minutes. Pandemic clearly belongs to our most popular games. And I highly recommend the expansion. ",30549,Pandemic

634536,anubis_cuk,8.5,"Not the most attractive of games physically, but the game is split into three phases of three turns so tactics change depending on the cards available (you get 1 out of 5, chosen in order). There is a lot of player interaction and countless opportunities to shaft other players which is always fun :)",93,El Grande
699413,anubis_cuk,8.5,"Good fun, very quick, a good balance of luck and strategy, although this is lacking somewhat without the expansions.",147020,Star Realms
713738,anubis_cuk,7,Despite the high luck element in the cards you get (ie no defense against a single breakage card can cripple a player) the game is very well balanced and works well with 5 or more players. Quick and a good laugh.,9220,Saboteur
751492,anubis_cuk,8.5,"A nicely produced game with the exception of the tacky plastic spaceships. The flares add a lot to the original game, also the research technology option is nice. More alien powers, a good laugh.",39463,Cosmic Encounter
773640,anubis_cuk,7,"Quite quick, very silly but it was better than I expected when I saw the theme and the artwork of the cards. Some thought, but having 2 races working in each deck worked well and would add replayability.",122522,Smash Up

899705,anubis_cuk,8.5,"Far too long and slow with 6 players, 3 or 4 is the optimum and the game plays very well.

Even if the stories have limited outcomes,  the varieties of characters and player cards make you want to tackle the game from every different angle so the replay-ability is not at all in question. Highly recommend if you are into solo gaming.  And NO, you don't need two cores.

1016017,anucha_darkangel,10,"Pandemic Legacy is a great game that implements an amazing story-line to an already-existing mechanically-genius game. Even with its flaws, you can't deny that its mother, Pandemic, is the go-to beginner-friendly co-orperative board game, and even a staple for some.  No Spoilers in terms of its story-line here, all you need to know is that it is good; it keeps you on edge while introducing new components and mechanics at every corner.   It carries over flaws from the original pandemic though, which is LUCK. Sometimes you draw out the first 9 infection cards and it makes you feel like reshuffling the deck and resetting up the game. In some game you just plan to lose so you have a higher advantage for the next. Overall, it is deservedly a high ranking game that you'll definitely remember the joy or the struggle (in a good way) of playing for a very long time.    And yes, you can use Pandemic Legacy to play regular Pandemic after you finish the legacy campaign, just make sure to reduce the stickiness of the stickers before use (and not to destroy any card). It even has a bigger board than the regular Pandemic so that's a plus.",161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1

161852,Anzelak,10,"Coming from someone who feels the original Pandemic is just a tiny bit overrated, this game is an absolute masterpiece. Probably my game of the year. Legacy games look like they're a very good idea.  Edit: one of the greatest gaming experiences I've had so far.",161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1
227891,Anzelak,9.5,"I finally succumbed to X-Wing at about the time the Imperial Aces were released. Foolishly, I bought the core set for my brother’s birthday and we played it together. Then we played it again. Then again. And then again.  There have been few games in recent memory that have had such an immediately positive impact on me. It’s so simple; it’s so neat and logical; it’s so fun and thematic. There and then at the table we each agreed to sink a silly amount of money into buying more of these expensive little plastic ships.  That said, I don’t feel that X-Wing is offensively overpriced either. I’ve often been put off many other miniature games I’d probably love by the prohibitively expensive costs of starting the hobby. But here I don't feel ripped off when I pay around £11 or 12 for an ""expansion pack"".  X Wing also gets plus points from me because I detest painting models – and I think these ships are far nicer looking than the Star Trek (and now D&D Attack Wing) stuff from WizKids.  The ridiculous part of all this is that I’m not actually a very big Star Wars fan – though it might always have been the rabid, lunatic fans that put me off the franchise rather than the films themselves.  Anyway, in short, this game is insane. Stay the hell away from it if you have disposable income you’d like to keep in your pockets.  One noticeable downside is that it can actually take quite a bit of effort to get it on the table and playing when you have plenty of different ships if you don't invest in decent ways to organise your X-wing gear.",103885,Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game
432745,Anzelak,8,"Like so many games of its class, Sheriff is heavily reliant on having no moody douchebags in the group to spoil the fun. This one is excellent. It’s bluffing and negotiation with plenty of game there behind the core concepts. That plastic popping noise makes the game.  Some observations: I would definitely recommend using the accompanying app for a better experience; use the three minute timer without fail. Using the extra-rulesy contraband cards makes for a much better experience when people know what they're doing.  Whenever this hits the table, our group have an absolute blast.  Rarely, it can feel slightly too long.",157969,Sheriff of Nottingham
462998,Anzelak,9,"Insanely good game. I've racked up hours of playtime of Agricola with my ""non-gamer"" wife and she seems perfectly content to play Caverna too. Played it a bunch of times with ""game-i-er"" folk as well and loved it. The components are absolutely brilliant and the sheer amount of them feels completely gratuitous – which is exactly what I like",102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers
497220,Anzelak,9,Will easily become the go-to party game. It's phenomenally good. Just be aware that it can suffer from downtime if a spymaster is being a little too thinky with the clues. The provided sand timer is gold for this.,178900,Codenames
554431,Anzelak,7.5,"It's great. I waited bloody ages to play this as it was nearly impossible to find and I was surprised that when I actually sat down to play it lived up to expectations. It's by no means a mind-blowing game, but it looks wonderful, stays fun and gives you plenty to think about. I wonder if it'll feel samey once you've figured out an optimal build. I'm sure expansions will fix that as the system itself is good fun.",143884,Machi Koro
654524,Anzelak,7.5,"I enjoyed playing this game but it feels overly long when you're playing a game with players who aren't used to it. At the end of the day, the down time is quite high. There's plenty of waiting around while people read the text on their cards. I think there are better games out there.  Edit: this is a good game. You just have to be very careful about who you bring it out with. Slow players who won't roll with the punches and have a go at playing things quickly - guys prone to AP - will cause you problems with this one.",122522,Smash Up

40989,aoshi2012,10,,70323,King of Tokyo
116392,Aoshi312,10,Some games you just play and you can SEE the amazingly intricate game design at work. Yes the theme is dry and Im not usually into economic games but this one is a real winner. Easy to learn but difficult to master. I love slowly spreading out my empire and constantly crossing paths with my opponents. You are active every turn of this game and it is surprisingly fast paced. I also love that the scoring basically implies that you should be focusing on EVERYTHING in the game.,124361,Concordia
166726,Aoshi312,9.5,Build a galactic empire with dice! I love that the game has simultaneous play and that the iconography is pretty simple to figure out after a round or two. Generally the better player will win. Roll handfuls of dice but don’t have to worry too much about the luck of the roll since there’s plenty of dice luck mitigation. Plays well at all player counts too.,132531,Roll for the Galaxy
265779,Aoshi312,10,Very thematic. Would be a 10 except that deck construction takes a lot of time and energy so it’s not a game you can just pull off the shelf and play.   Edit: I’ve now put the time in to learn to deck build and also finished the Dunwich Campaign and this has become one of my favorite games of all time. You really need to plan ahead. Love it both solo and multiplayer though I enjoy it more with others since I think you can focus more on the theme and less on mechanics.,205637,Arkham Horror: The Card Game
344004,Aoshi312,10,,96848,Mage Knight Board Game
344223,Aoshi312,9.5,I absolutely love this game. I love that every game feels COMPLETELY different both due to alien powers and the other humans at the table. The negotiation aspects are solid and you are pretty much involved in everything that happens in the game. Games without downtime are highly valued in my group. Loses half a point because it’s not for everyone. Players have to be willing to talk and negotiate.,39463,Cosmic Encounter
452371,Aoshi312,9,An excellent game of tile placement and ship building followed by dangerous adventure that destroys the ship you so painstakingly built. Laugh out loud fun. Unexpectedly tactical. Very fun.,31481,Galaxy Trucker
559104,Aoshi312,10,No spoilers! Just get a group of four people together and play this game. It’s worth your time.,161936,Pandemic Legacy: Season 1
614621,Aoshi312,8,Really fun game! Only issue is it can be extremely messy/random at times you if you really care about strategy and winning this probably isnt the game for you.,158899,Colt Express
668558,Aoshi312,9,The stories this game will tell are tremendous. If you dont like a traitor you can play without one while greatly increasing the difficulty of the game. My group tends to play without a traitor but personally I think it plays best with one since it adds some much needed untrustworthyness to the game. The best zombie game thematically and mechanically in my opinion.,150376,Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game
694279,Aoshi312,7.5,"Take any two factions and smash them together to create the ultimate deck! Playing with experienced players I’d rate this a 9 but since I’m often teaching it to new people, the game can seriously drag when no one knows their deck. ",122522,Smash Up
712154,Aoshi312,8.5,"With the right crowd, this game can be a 10 out of 10. Wheeling and dealing. Lying through your teeth and eking out a last minute victory. Unfortunately repeated plays with the same group can become tiresome since the meta will change the more you play together. Can also fall apart if some don’t understand the game. Still can provide some of the most exciting moments in gaming.",128882,The Resistance: Avalon
719790,Aoshi312,9,"One of my absolutely favorite games to play solo. Stranded on an island with nothing but your wits and a friendly native to help you. Multiple scenarios and a tough as nails coop experience. You will get better at the more you play it but in the fight of man vs nature, nature usually wins. ",121921,Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island
740736,Aoshi312,8,Lying and bribing your way into town in the struggle to get the best goods and earn the most money. I love the mechanic of putting your goods into a bad and trying to convince them not to open it. Even more satisfying than sneaking in some counterfeit goods? Bluffing the sheriff into opening your bag full of legal goods and seeing them have to pay you for the trouble. ,157969,Sheriff of Nottingham
812145,Aoshi312,8,One of the first coop games I owned. If you enjoy making plenty of Monty python jokes and talking in awful accents you’ll enjoy this coop with a possible traitor in the midst. The gameplay certainly doesn’t fit the them but it’s still a fun game and plays up to 7!,15062,Shadows over Camelot
868137,Aoshi312,8,I love Coup. Just the right amount of lying to your friends without being too stressful. I like that there is a lot game involved too. Trying to get enough money to Coup another player before they can do the same to you. Has player elimination but games go very quickly and are fun to watch even when youre eliminated.,131357,Coup
985037,Aoshi312,9.5,Absolutely fantastic! I love the look and feel of the game and I also love how well everything is marked on the board so it’s easy to teach and remember. The simple amount of actions you have but the insane cascade of choices you have to make to win is what keeps me coming back. Great play length too.,169786,Scythe

495249,apertotes,8,"Colt Express is a simple and very amusing action programming game set in a train heist on the wild west. Each player plays the role of a different robber with a special ability and they have to program their whole turn without knowing what the other players will be doing exactly, or at all.  During the resolution phase, there are lots of hilarious moments like air punches and encounters with the marshall (and because of it, characters going up when they wanted to go down to pick up a case and vice-versa).  Some may say that the game is overproduced. I won't argue that. I'll simply enjoy the result of that excess.",158899,Colt Express
719661,apertotes,9,"Battlestar Galactica is an incredible game. It really captures the spirit of the show. After a few turns, paranoia kicks in and everybody looks like a treacherous cylon.  I dislike most hidden role games because during the first turns players start making blind accusations simply to keep the game moving, because the game is just that. However, in BSG the game is already a worthy opponent so for the first turns there may be no need to accuse anybody because maybe nobody earnt that accusation. It is not until someone starts behaving suspiciously that players need to start accusing and sending characters to the brig.  But not only the hidden role mechanic is well done, on top of that there is a very good game of resource management with a bit of space combat and politics.  There are only two downsides to this amazing game: it needs at least 5 players to really have an interesting game and it runs very long.  The silver lining is that unlike many modern games, it plays fantastically well with 5 players, and more with expansions.",37111,Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game

Even in the basic game, without cards, there are lots of different avenues to success. We've seen players win with only 3 family members, and we've seen players win with a wood home. We've seen players win by carefully building and sustaining a food engine, and we've seen players fish all the way to victory.  And then, once you are comfortable with the basic game, you can add 7 occupations and 7 minor improvements for each player (out of several decks that contain hundreds of unique cards) that will make each game completely different.  It's precisely those decks of cards and the harsher feeding what, for me, elevates Agricola heads and shoulders over Caverna.",31260,Agricola

A great game with a lot of detail and lots of tough decisions in a short play time. I like it best as 2 player advanced rules with Gathering Storm and goals. Excellent solo, too (solitaire robot from Gathering Storm).  Contrary to some, I think the iconography is well done and very intuitive. And I find that the cards are quite thematic and well-named.

Good for families, as with it being a cooperative game you don't have to worry about letting younger players win or older players steamrolling.  Overall, it's a great game for casual and younger players who want a thrilling cooperative experience. Groups of purely older players might find the game to be a bit simple eventually, however there's a nice mechanic that allows you to set the appropriate difficulty. However, remember that difficulty does not really enhance depth.",65244,Forbidden Island

861689,Apparos Achaparos,8.5,I find far superior to Agricola in every way. I never thought i'd like it before i played it. It feels far smoother than agricola and it is far less random and more strategic due to the absence of hidden cards that only one player can exploit. The best thing is the lack of point scoring for generalising as in agricola. Here you can specialise all the way and any way you want.   The only problems i found in the design are the terrific dependence on everyone playing correctly and the massive AP it induces. ,35677,Le Havre

An ideal filler for two to play while waiting for another game with gamer friends to finish:  you can play 1 round in five minutes, 2 rounds in ten minutes, and so on.  Giving it a 7.  May 2012.  Okay, although this is quite simple, and can feel a bit auto-pilot mindless at times, the design and experience are quite good.  Raising it to an 8.  October 2014.    This game manages to please and intrigue just about everyone who plays it for the first time, particularly non-gamers, and its design manages to pack many ""good game"" design principles into a very small package.  Simply put, the game decisions are interesting and pleasing on many different levels.  With some hesitation, but respect necessitated by several key factors, going to raise this to a 9.  August 2015.",50,Lost Cities

377212,Apple Paul,8,"Love this game.  Probably my favorite ""abstract mixed with puzzle solving"" game.  Available everywhere, a definite gaming phenom.  Clearly, lots of people like this game.",2453,Blokus
393513,Apple Paul,9,"November 2013:  Picked it up at Essen, without having played it, with first play of Caverna when I got home.  A solid, interesting to play sequel to Agricola that is about 75% Agricola and 25% new material, including buildings, dogs, mines, rubies and expeditions.  Interestingly, this sequel has more harvests, but less stress in feeding your family.    And Caverna features many more ways to easily earn victory points, every turn. Thus, curiously, Caverna pushes the Agricola franchise in a somewhat Feldian direction: everything earns you victory points! Hey, players undoubtedly prefer it.   (And for dog lovers, ha, the dogs are fun to have as well, because they can live anywhere on your board and watch sheep very nicely, without benefit of fences!  Excellent.)   If played competitively, Caverna should become a much more complex, competitive brain burner than Agricola, because there are no hidden cards, or surprising card plays to disrupt your best laid plans or to blame for your loss, and there are more moving parts to play with and more ways to earn VP's.  All the information is right there in front of all the players, in the form of action spaces and various permutations of buildings that can be built to provide interesting resource or VP engines.  So good luck figuring out what the absolute best play is...at each moment in the game.  (I know, but I am not telling.)  In addition, it seems like there are more ""combination actions spaces"" in Caverna, with dual and sometimes triple actions involved.  Thus, you end up weighing combination against combination a bit more in Caverna than you do in Agricola, a slightly more complex decision than many of the ""single action versus single action"" decisions in Agricola.  Bottom line: this is a good euro to play, aside and apart from any (obvious) relationship it has with Agricola.  Giving it an 8 of 10.  May 2014:  Going to raise this to a 9 of 10 for its sheer weight of design, replayability, and euro-worker placement complexity.  This is a euro gamers' game of the highest order, or at least complexity of decision making, with a cornucopia of things to get in this game.    I particularly love the rubies and the ridiculously complicated decisions on what combinations of goods to take on high armament quests late in the game.  For my first action on the last turn of the game, I will use my ruby to violate the placement order rule, so that I have to figure out the optimal combination of 4 goods to take on this list of 12?  Are you kidding me?! : ) Love it.",102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers
406024,Apple Paul,9,"A fun, challenging game.  A real ""gamers' game"" that demands a lot of concentration...if you plan to win.  I think this game is properly considered the granddaddy of many subsequent euro's (including Hansa Teutonica).  It utilizes so many mechanisms that other games subsequently incorporated.  I particularly love the way the turn order is determined in this game.  Way way back (was it 1995?), this was the first game to introduce me to the concept of structuring a game such that one element of the game would involve players competing to advantageously determine turn order.  ",93,El Grande
462712,Apple Paul,8,"Pleasant and interesting in a mellow sort of way.  Giving this a 7of 10.  May 2011.  Having played Alhambra now a number of times, I now recognize that Alhambra is a well designed euro with a bit of magic in its design.  Who would have thought that a mechanic wherein ""paying exact change allows for an extra turn"" could be so fun to play with?  Exact change!!  Bottom line:  IMHO Alhambra is probably the ideal gateway game to introduce first time euro gamers to euro gaming, making Alhambra a deserving euro classic.  Raising my rating to an 8 of 10.  March 2020.",6249,Alhambra
470802,Apple Paul,8,"This game assuredly breaks the rule against player elimination, but it does so within the context of a very brief game, and an otherwise very enjoyable experiment in human interaction.    The social aspect of the game, and the possible alliance building possibilities in a 5 or 6 player game give this game the definite ability to please a lot of people and non-gamer partygoers who are willing to sit down and play a short game for the heck of it.    Once they grasp the card interactions, chances are just about everyone will find something to like in ""the experience"" of playing at least three hands of this game.  Reminds me a little bit of Nanuk in that this game manages to create a party game out of very little...though this game is MUCH better than Nanuk.",131357,Coup
472834,Apple Paul,9,"The all time classic, still waiting to be dethroned as the top thinking person's game in the world.  (Okay, for two.)  Is there a game designer out there who can dethrone it?  Is Hive a contender? ",171,Chess
562886,Apple Paul,9,Lots of interesting decisions.  Kind of a euro victory point celebration with so many different ways to obtain victory points.  Definitely a top quality gamers' game.   ,18602,Caylus
723383,Apple Paul,7,"A worthy gateway game that might be considered in the family of Settlers of Cataan in that it allows players to roll the dice on their turn, and have their roll affect every other player's fortunes, which of course, is a desirable design feature to keep everyone interested in every roll.  This attribute explains, in part, the success of Settlers.  The design also cleverly includes a progression from rolling one die to two, and card capabilities/rewards split between those that apply when the player rolls, and those that apply when other players roll.  Is this a gamers' game that I am going to want to play often?  No, not really.  Nevertheless, this game might serve nicely as a gateway game, and please a lot of non-gamers.  I certainly prefer this dice roller to Yahtzee, and I might even prefer it to Settlers at this point in my game playing history.",143884,Machi Koro

Easy to learn, hard to master and plays suprisingly different each time, even though there is very little random elements and no luck involved. It has a nice amount of interaction and every decision is a tough one. It's also in my opinion a great and tight 2-player game. I actually think it plays best with two. It does need the expansion buildings in order to have enough variance for dozens of plays against same players. The 2nd edition/Anniversary-edition art is great and the game even has some theme to it.  Fun factor: 5/5 Strategy vs. luck: 5/5 Mechanics/gameplay tied to the theme: 3/5 Component/art quality: 4/5 (with ""Anniversary""-edition art, but thin cardboard and awful coins) Replayability: 5/5 (with the ""New Buildings""-expansion)",3076,Puerto Rico

371036,Arah,9,"[b]Micro Review:[/b] Lost Cities is a competitive game for 2 players. Win by getting the highest score, which is a sum of all your lanes played. Each lane and investment played gives negative points, so you better go all in if you want to actually score.  Simplest Engine Building - Intro to Strategy - Hand Management - Easy to play  [b]Why I love it?[/b] -Very simple rules and fast to setup and play. Fun, with some depth and some luck. -A good gateway and introductory game.  [b]Why it may not be for you?[/b] -A lot of gamers crave complex mechanisms. This one is simple and works well, to each their own. -While skill plays a very important part, there is also a good amount of luck involved. I prefer luck in short games, because that bridges the inevitable skill gap and allows worse players to win sometimes.  [b]Starter Kit:[/b] You only need the base game. Some people prefer the 6-lane version over the original 5.  [b]Player Scaling:[/b] Strictly a 2p game. Don't even bother with the other versions.",50,Lost Cities
605351,Arah,9,"[b]Micro Review:[/b] X-wing is a competitive miniature skirmish game. Players will build their squadrons belonging to a faction, with unique ship maneuvers and loadout. Then, players will simultaneously program their ship's movement, all in a physical play field.  Pilot Sim - Ameritrash  [b]Why I love it?[/b] Physically moving and eyeballing distances feels like piloting. The simultaneous maneuver progremming also allows you to 'outfly' your opponent.  [b]Why it may not be for you?[/b] While the basic rules are streamlined, each new wave of content adds a lot of FAQ interactions.  [b]Starter Kit:[/b] Expect to get all the content, and multiples.  [b]Player Scaling:[/b] While you can play a multiplayer or team vs team battle, the game is designed to play as 1 vs 1.",103885,Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game
811577,Arah,9,"[b]Concordia micro review:[/b] Concordia is the definition of a pure euro game, with very few ways to mess with your opponents but with a lot of indirect interaction and integrated mechanisms. You get resources via action cards and province harvesting, build your card engine (including their built in VP scoring) and expand on the map.  Subtlety - Harmony - Strategy  [b]Why I love it?[/b] -The mechanisms are well integrated, create a lot of interesting decisions and tensions and allow a lot of strategic depth and subtlety. -The minor setup variations make the game highly replayable. -The cards, setup and market order create a lot of different viable strategies. -There is a lot of harmony in the player interaction, sharing province spaces and resources.  [b]Why it may not be for you?[/b] -First playthrough is confusing as you need to get used to the scoring. -Very dry. They need to hire a graphic designer to rework the UI (the box art is fine).  [b]Settings[/b]: -Use the salt resource. Use Italy or Gallia map for 3p. Use Byzantium for 4p.  [b]Alternatives[/b]: Black Angel and On Mars both feature massively better graphic design. All 3 games are excellent 3p euros.  [b]Player Scaling:[/b] 2p could work in a very small map, but the mechanics don't scale well. 3p is very strategic. 4p is a bit more chaotic, but still an excellent game. 5-6p takes way too long.",124361,Concordia

But after checking 2 different runners and 2 different corp decks, I'm really impressed. It is still same old Netrunner, that I was loving to play 15 years ago.  For minus:  - I still prefer the old art - Cyberpunk 2020 theme is much more interesting then Android one  Pluses:  - Different factions for Runner and Corp - Deck creation and influence - Small tweaks making the game more fluent to play  For now it's 9/10, but it may increase. I'm still exploring only base set.  Update after 4 games  Score goes up to 9.33.   I've played with, or against all factions. The game play is great, the factions are way different . I like this game more and more. Core set is enough for casual players, especially that all factions seems to be balanced.  ",124742,Android: Netrunner

870683,Aratar,8,"Funny game with lots of Chrome. Feels like a mix of Munchkin and a war game, but I don't mind.  It removes two of the standard flaws of war games by: 1) Not letting you chose who to attack (cards will decide that) 2) Making it possible for your opponent to win territory without you losing it.  Best game of 2009 so far (June 2009).",39463,Cosmic Encounter

949728,Aratar,8.5,Feels more static due to the loss of the minor improvements and occupation cards. Also lacks some of the tension from Agricola. I am also not sure about the balance of the exploring part of the game. It seems like you won't have a chance of winning if you don't pursue exploring. Still a good game though!  So after one play the conclusion is clear: Agricola remains my favorite!,102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers

968347,Aratar,8,Apart from Shadows over Camelot the only game from Bruno Cathala that I actually enjoy.  A quite complex game compared to the usual family weight titles from DoW.  The game is all about chosing the right group of meeples to move and the way to place them. Lots of difficult choices. Can be a bit prolonged with AP prone players - it might be a good idea to use a clock if you happen to play with that kind of players. ,157354,Five Tribes

494206,ArborBarber,9.2,"For me, the two most impressive things about the game are how well it works both coop and solo and how satisfying the rpg elements are. I generally hate coop games (ugh I can’t stand pandemic; so quarterback-y) but AH absolves the sins of the genre in my book.  The storytelling opportunities too are great. In our last game, my unwashed but lovable rogue and his dog went ham and made a scene in a fancy Italian restaurant to attract the attention of the bad guys while my wife’s erudite researcher babe snuck in the back and investigated some freaky business. Then the interdimensional slime really hit the fan.  Wouldn’t mind just a biiiiiitttt more replayability with the core set though, especially since we really need 2 copies of it to deckbuild properly. But who am I kidding, just take my money FFG.  Upgraded to a 9.2 with Dunwich Legacy. Extra scenarios and deckbuilding options add a lot.",205637,Arkham Horror: The Card Game

611170,ArborBarber,9,"Maybe the greatest worker placement game? (Sorry Agricola, I love you too.) Tzolkin wins against the competition for its replayability, number of valid strategies, and the depth that the unique resource ""time"" adds to the game. It doesn't hurt that the game looks and feels great (turning those gears is just so satisfying).   The true test is this game's longevity in my collection: I am always thrilled to whip this baby out, and the same cannot be said of every game that has dwelt in my stack for as many years. I'd recommend this game to anyone.  Lowering score 9.4->9 because while it's still one of my favorites, I've realized that certain strategies are a little broken. It's a bit unfair to play with rookies as a result, because playing counterintuitively with that hidden knowledge creates an imbalance in way that other more symmetric worker placement games do not. Since declaring Tzolkin my favorite, I've been enjoying Feast for Odin and Keyflower a bit more, for this reason.",126163,Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar

Different, fresh, exciting, tricky, smooth, full of flavour... I could go on forever. If there was an 11 to give, I'd rate it 11 and then some. Buy! Play! Enjoy!",170216,Blood Rage
29201,Arboretum,10,"One of the very best games I know! A brilliant concept, very exciting. The TIME flies while you play. The truly fascinating thing is how the plot develops and how you investigate piece by piece until the complex story unravels. It feels like living an episode of ""Dr Who"" trying to intervene in one of ""Sherlock""'s cases.  If you love theme based games that tell a story above all, you will not find any  better. It is also a good way of introducing people to the concept of role play because it works in a similar way as far as the activities of the players are concerned.  If you do not like role play and prefer more regular board games on the eurogame side, you should not buy it.",146508,T.I.M.E Stories

107795,Arboretum,9,"You cannot really compare this game to many others. It is nice, colourful, intriguing, almost whimsical on first sight, but it is really hard and takes a lot of foresight and strategy if you want to win against the sandstorm, find the pieces of the artefact - an ancient aircraft - under all that sand that keeps accumulationg and threatenig to bury your thirsty character under so many dunes, and fly away to safety and civilization. Clever and exciting!",136063,Forbidden Desert

488637,Arboretum,9,"Beautiful Azul is a game to calm your nerves. It is clever, competative, and at the same time it makes you feel happier, even if you lose. It is the prettiness of the design, the colours, the calm way of playing, the clarity and simplicity of the rules, the depth and strategic complexity that makes it a challenge - but in an unexcited and peaceful way - that make this game a gem. Azul also has the tactile element. Handling the pretty pieces, the tiles, simply feels good. It also takes up fairly little tablespace and has a short setup time, so you can just put the box on the table and are ready to play in no tme at all. A must-have! Azul will be a classic.",230802,Azul

We use the draft variant and i do not think it is luck dependant that way. The nastiness of some cards is overstated since they hardly have impact on the game. They just add a little spice and interaction which is needed to make the game a richer experience.,167791,Terraforming Mars

Si se encuentra un grupo de juego que guste de la saga y de los juegos belicos (wargames) tendrás mucha diversión.  Es verdad que el juego puede estár desbalanceado entre las casas dependiendo el número de jugadores que se tengan, pero esto sólo da más variedad al juego, donde sabiendo que un bando tiene ventajas en ciertas situaciones, es deber de los demás detenerlo, las alianzas reales y falsas dan gran juego y no se hace tedioso ni lento una vez pasado unos turnos de la primera partida.  En definitiva, uno de los juegos que más diversión me ha dado, mucha tensión y mucha risa. Me ha divertido mucho más que otros juegos con mejor puntuación aquí.

Este juego lo logra muy bien, todo el tiempo se siente la tensión de estar en una mala posición, de no poder cumplir los objetivos o sobrevivir. Es un juego denso y emocionante, sobre todo en las últimas decisiones.

Bad things keep falling on your head, and you can succeed only with a good coordination and strategy. A lot of tough decisions, but a lot less fiddy than Arkham. The game is quite expensive, but offers already a lot of replayability.

Getting more unit feels like composing an army. Leveling-up and choosing skills also well executed as an rpg game. City combat feels a bit too long,96848,Mage Knight Board Game

55922,Arctic Jack,10,"The first game I really took to. It's probably inferior to Go on the grand scale of things but it's about taste. If I had the same knowledge of Go as I do of Chess I'd probably like Go more. The clash of minds in this game, the zero luck, the sacrifices, the combinations, the defence and attack and most of all though the possibility of a checkmate. An instant kill which nothing in Go can compare makes this game for me.  (Chess board and pieces at mothers) (Portable board in attic) (Mini board in filing cabnet) ",171,Chess
67081,Arctic Jack,10,"A game I long time ignored as I wasn't particularly drawn to word games. Reading ‘Word Freak’ by Stefan Fatsis opened up the whole Scrabble scene to me and I liked what I saw. As usual I needed some nice gear to play with, so after a little research I bought a SamBoard and a few books to learn the basics.",320,Scrabble
119135,Arctic Jack,9,"Initial rating after only a handful of games. Nice, light on rules abstract that is easily accessible for the family. Can be played quick and light or deep and heavy.

Possibly move to an 8 in the future.   *** I'm now missing the single red square piece from the Giant edition if anyone can help me please? ***",2453,Blokus
533073,Arctic Jill,9,I was quite surprised I liked this game considering there are no elements of luck involved. When I first heard the rules I thought it was going to be extremely complex and hard to play but after just one round I found it quite easy to get a grasp of the mechanics.

Netrunner remains a game that I judge all others against, representing much of the best of structured card game formats.

221946,Ardent,10,When you are first confronted with the behemoth that is Arkham Horror it may seem a little daunting. But the game is not difficult to learn – it's just complex. Once you get the basic mechanics it's a breeze to play. Still – you have to like long games with lots (lots!) of cards and markers. Arkham Horror is a great cooperative game which nicely evokes an atmosphere of adventure and impending doom. It's a great game to spend the entire evening with.,15987,Arkham Horror

The Road to Legend App though turns this into a fully co op classic dungeon crawl and makes it one of the best in the genre to boot!

86150,arhpositive,10,"Cosmic Encounter is a fantastic game of diplomacy and asset management. The main game loop is simple to understand. New players can start the game after a 25 minute introduction. The aliens, however, give each game a distinct feeling and that is where the game shines. Even using only the base game aliens, there are lots of special powers and flare cards to explore and interactions to experience between players.  Players will need a certain amount of luck regarding card draw, but almost every bad situation and terrible hand in Cosmic Encounter could be manipulated and turned into an advantage with smart play. Social skills are also a necessity, as you've to talk your friends into supporting you and not your opponent. This game is not for people who doesn't like table talk in board games.  If you like big games with social aspects, if you commonly have a 5-6 player table at your game nights, if you always play a game at least a few times before judging randomness factors in it, this might be the go-to game for your gaming group.

Since I'm not coming from RftG, I can't compare between these two games.  Over time, I kept enjoying this game and its clever usage of dice.

Appeals widely to the masses yet has a great amount of depth to it.

Maybe even best WP (it beats overrated Keyflower) And maybe even best gateway in general. It have been the favourite game of my group with 100+ plays, and we never seem to get bored with it yet.  The only con is the theme, which is laughable for an euro and may detract potentional gamers. But luckily there is no miniatyres here.",110327,Lords of Waterdeep
1020125,arildoaim,8.5,"edit: After some plays of this (and TM) it seems like it reveals itself to be slightly else: Concordia is basicly a race game to get most cards. In games where players do their building optimally and elegant moves, they would still lose out to a player who mindlessly rush buys as many cards as possible. This can be migitated if everyone is aware and plays accordingly. But with it speeding play and onesided objective the game turns into something else, and the feel of building something disappear completely. So if you are looking for a civ building game, look elsewhere   --- Strong game, with Great scalability, plays well at all counts. Should be brought to all playnights for this reason alone  I would compare this by a longshot with terraforming mars, both are carddriven vp-optimalization by executing an efficient engine as possible. Not something in generl i like, But this shines with its shared map, allowing for more player interaction than expected (still medium compared to games like hansa teutonica, but massive compared to TM). I also had a greater feel of meaty oldschool board game feel, and great sense of achivement by slowly bulding and expanding.  still som caveats: - AP prone - Non intuitve scoring objectives, takes several plays to know - seems like little room for big chain plays (tm and hansa t much stronger here). Still i have seen things like players building 4 houses on different spots in one turn.",124361,Concordia

491443,arkainus,9.5,"I played from Revised up through Shards. The game is incredible, and the community that has risen up around it is great. You could always play a net deck if you were feeling uninspired, but nothing to me was more satisfying than coming up with your own deck and crushing your friends, especially in some janky way. So if it is so great, why did I get rid of it? Honestly it was the money sink, which is a hazard with any CCG (or hobby in general I suppose). I found myself paying more and more and playing less and less. As IRL people kept falling off the wayside of playing this game, I turned to Magic Online, but I would continually find myself playing jerks - they either taunt you when they are winning or they gripe continually of you being a ""lucksack"" if they were losing and then timing out their connection. I just found myself having no fun playing anymore, so I had to let it go. Every once in a while I check in on the state of the game, and it makes me want to start playing again, but that ship has sailed.  ",463,Magic: The Gathering

483165,Arkeas,9,Absolutely loving this one. Variable setup and player buildings keep the game from feeling too samey from play-to-play. The hand/deck-managent combined with a board that changes over time and worker placement just does it for me. Couldn't be happier with it.,193738,Great Western Trail

594285,Arkeas,8,"Putting ""not an abstract game"" on the box's description doesn't make it any less of an abstract game. I don't usually go for abstracts but this one is quick and light enough to avoid losing me. Absolutely gorgeous to look at. Some of the iconography isn't intuitive but the variable player powers are a welcome addition to add some variety to the game.",194655,Santorini
729301,Arkeas,8,"Collector's edition is just like the base game, only huge! Massive panda figure is even more adorable. The weather die is a little terrifying as it thunders across the table. There's something incredibly satisfying about digging around for huge bamboo pieces in the box. The original game looked great while playing it but the collector's edition just makes it look even more beautiful. Very easy to learn. Seems very simple but offers some interesting light strategy. Nice, colourful artwork and the miniatures are really cute. Great light strategy game.",70919,Takenoko
750422,Arkeas,8,The premise is really bizarre; build a space ship out of pipes and go fly it. Everything goes horribly wrong right from the start as bits start falling off.

831909,Arkeas,9,"First exposure to FFG's LCG format. This is an interesting approach to a card game and offers great stories combined with fun card play. It offers more narrative than the Arkham Horror board game and is less chaotic than Elder Sign and does a great job at capturing the Lovecraftian feeling. Scenarios are highly replayable thanks to the ever-growing array of investigators and a number of them offer some randomization as to which copy of various locations come into play.

8598,ArkhamSign,10," This one clearly ranks as one of our favorite Euros. A worker placement game with simple rules and just enough strategy to keep you thinking from the first move to the last. You move about Istanbul (was Constantinople!) collecting wares and selling them or using them to buy the rubies you need to win the game. Along the way you gamble, have your near do well family go out & do some business for you and even visit a beautiful fountain. The production is top notch and the theme is fairly strong if off-putting to some. We love it a lot. We are really hoping an expansion or two might come out because that will make this already great game a perfect 10 possibly. ",148949,Istanbul

Take cash from the bank, buy a building for your Alhmabra or rearrange buildings already in your Alhambra. That's it. But there is a good amount of strategy in this game mixed with the luck of the card draws from the bank. Heavy Eurogamers might think this is too simple and they are probably right.

Each turn those dice rolls give you hard decisions to make. Take a building from the board, place said building or get workers to help you next turn. And while there is the chance you'll get shut out of what you really want you are never left without an option. It plays very easy.

And a very good game to boot. It incorporates many mechanic and styles of play into a small box. It feels like a civilization building game,. plays like a deck builder and works like set collection.

""Core Worlds for Dummies"" if you will. We tried Core Worlds before and were totally gob-smacked with how mathy (nope not a word either but you get the idea) it is. The game should come with a calculator. But Star Realms takes the concept of building up forces in your armada/system to attack your adversary and makes it so simple it's almost obscene. LOL.

You collect resources via some poker-style chips and use them to purchase cards from a central display. Those cards add to a permanent set of resources you control that aid in purchasing more expensive cards from the central display again. It is simple but brings out a complex game that moves along at a steady pace and never wears out its welcome. This game should win the Spiel award it has been nominated for. We don't think there is another game out there that plays as smooth and as seamlessly as this one but still brings out so much fun. ",148228,Splendor

And despite what the rules say you can easily play 2-player on the Empire side of the board without it bogging down the game or making it too easy for anyone. It's a must have in our opinion.

375341,ArkhamSign,9,"A fun war game (and we know there are real die hard war gamers screaming at us for calling it such but that's what it is to us)to own.

It's simple, elegant and above all fun. ",10630,Memoir '44
383191,ArkhamSign,9,"It's a globe spanning adventure with horrific mysteries to solve and sanity-shattering forces to combat. But ... It just cannot hold a candle to Arkham Horror for us. Despite it being wider in scope it doesn't feel as immersive. The concept of solving mysteries to accomplish your goals instead of closing gates is novel but in order to make that goal viable the game must have a timer. And the mythos deck serves that purpose. But we just do not like that timer aspect. Plus if the mystery cards get drawn in a certain order you can be stalled out quite quickly. During one game fighting Cthulhu, the epic monster corresponding to a certain mystery card came out and we were never able to defeat it.  So while Eldritch Horror draws you into a more expansive world the gameplay, unfortunately, contracts the experience in such a way that it feels smaller somehow.  It does however play in less time and gives you a more themtic game so it is a double-edged sword. It's best to think of Eldritch as a globe-spanning adventure and Arkham as a claustrophobic run through the haunted town.",146021,Eldritch Horror
441588,ArkhamSign,9,"Zee Garcia said it best. ""Suffering in a box."" It's still a good worker placement style game that draws you into this world of survival, despair and courage.

469168,ArkhamSign,9,One of our favorite worker placement game. Thank you Sam Healey from the Dice Tower for talking so much about this one. Love the theme and the artwork (my dream game room will have Michael Menzel game boards framed and mounted on the walls [I might have mentioned that before] )but most of all the game play. The resource gathering using the dice can be a bit random but it's easy to offset. The one thing we don't like about it is how the scores can go into the 100s. It's  just silly really. Why do the scores need to go that high? Our last game ended with a score of 265 to 242. That's insane. But it is the only dent in this otherwise flawless game. ,34635,Stone Age
500868,ArkhamSign,9,,266192,Wingspan
508726,ArkhamSign,9, This is one of our favorite worker placement games. With its easy game play and top rate quality components it should be near the top of everyone's list. But we will say one thing about it. Let's be honest. The D & D theme is pasted on. Don't get us wrong it is still an awesome game despite that. But we have to disagree with certain people (Richard Ham. we're talking to you) who believe this game can get RPGers into board games. We have been part of die hard RPG groups in the past and there is no way they'd consider this D & D. Reasonably certain they would all just look at us in a very cross manner were we to even suggest such a thing. ,110327,Lords of Waterdeep
607431,ArkhamSign,9,"This is 7 Wonders as the two player game we truly hoped it would be. It puts the two-player variant in 7 Wonders to shame. Instead of tradition drafting you take cards from a display between the players. Some cards are free (whether just costing nothing or perhaps having an icon that one of your cards in your tableau already has) or cost some resources that you will need to have built up before hand. But the display is set up so that as cards are taken, cards that were inaccessible become available. So it is a good give and take with you wanting the card in the display but seeing that taking it will allow your opponent to take a card that will help them. And the alternate victory conditions (getting enough military to decimate your opponent's civilization or getting enough science to make your civilization superior) make that card drafting from the display even more critical. You may want to take that science card that gets you closer to your victory but that will uncover a military card that will allow your foe to advance and make it even worse for you. Balanced perfectly, 7 Wonders Duel is one of the best two-player games on the market. ",173346,7 Wonders Duel

It is a very good hand management, set collection game with some really tight strategy. The only thing we don't like about it is that wonky scoring. Add up the numbers on the cards, multiply it by the number of this type of card  then subtract 20? It doesn't seem to complicated but we are always having to refer back to the rules and a calculator to see who won. Why does he always have to make scoring in his games so complicated?

851784,Arkku,9,"Extremely thematic, and co-op + LCG makes this not suffer any of the problems that collectible card games have for playing with less dedicated collectors/players.

El sistema de draft de cartas deja en el jugador toda la responsabilidad de si gana o pierde. Las figuras son muy bonitas, y la temática vikinga está perfectamente lograda.  ¿Lo Mejor? Hay varios caminos que conducen a la Victoria, en cada partida siempre eliges uno diferente.  ¿Lo Peor? No se lleva el 10 porque para tener una partida satisfactoria debes de conocer todas las cartas de antemano y planear un poco qué cartas usar y combinar con las de la siguiente era.  ¿Que le cambiaría? La caja. Es muy difícil de guardar las figuras cada partida. Necesitas comprar o hacerle un inserto si quieres ahorrar tiempo, aunque no es obligatorio.",170216,Blood Rage

No soy muy fan de estos juegos tipo puzle y mover, pero la forma en que se puntua lo hace adictivo.",230802,Azul

The game mechanic with a Powerplant market (4 power plants available with different stats) intertwined with the resource market it makes a really cool game. Both the markets make this one of the very best games that incorporate economic systems.   Though the game is a little bit light compared to the medium-heavy weight German-games like Puerto Rico and Caylus, it is very good, and very simple to play and explain.

621893,ArkTraveler,9,"A neatly balanced, asymmetric strategy game with a roughly 3 hour playtime, it both channels the source material and an ever-evolving landscape for scheming and aggression. The game can be won outright before reaching the turn limit if any one faction gets too strong, so alliances can be very fluid and only one out of the six kingdoms seems to require notably higher skill than the rest to win (not overtly underpowered but strategically in a difficult position to defend). Limited RNG and a supply limit for army size improve quality of play over some similar entries in this genre. My only major complaint is that balance seems to be significantly affected by number of players. #LowRNG #VictoryPoints #Strategy #Asymmetric",103343,A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)

The cooperative aspect of the game is well done and it always gets tense and exciting at the end when you're trying to get everyone on the ship to leave the desert.   My only gripe with the game is the difficulty. There are four difficulty levels: Novice, normal, advanced, and legendary. My group has only been able to win on ""normal"" a small fraction of the time we've played. Unless you get the perfect roles and everything goes perfectly, I just don't see how casual gamers are supposed to go above the normal difficulty.   Despite the difficulty, there is a lot of fun to be had here. If you like super challenging games, then this one is for you! Even if you're not, stick with the novice or normal difficulty and you'll have a blast.   Pros -components (the ship!!!) -ever-changing mechanics -variable roles -strong desert theme -excitement in flipping tiles  Cons -almost impossible difficulty on advanced and legendary tiers -possible alpha-player who decides everything for the whole team",136063,Forbidden Desert

Reglas mas limpias y elegantes, turnos mas rápidos, objetivos y eventos basados en el primigenio al que te enfrentas, fases de mitos mas interesantes, los monstruos aleatorios propios de una región aparecen en dicha región y no en cualquier zona al azar... La lista de mejoras es inmensa y no le encuentro (de momento) ningún defecto que lo haga peor que el Arkham Horror.",146021,Eldritch Horror
505631,arnora21,9,"J U E G A Z O!! Otro juego que va directo a mi lista de favoritos!  Sobre la famosa rejugabilidad:  La primera vez que juegas una misión (la que sea) es una experiencia increíble. La sensación de no saber que hay al otro lado de una puerta, de si te conviene o no abrirla en estos momentos, de si debieras investigar la misteriosa pila de papeles antiguos que hay sobre el escritorio antes de abandonar la habitación perdiendo un tiempo valioso con ello... para los que nos gusta este tipo de juegos de aventuras es alucinante.  La segunda vez (y siguientes) que te juegas la misma misión el escenario no es exactamente el mismo y los eventos que se suceden cambian lo suficiente como para que no puedas aprenderte ninguna misión de memoria. Incluso conociendo la trama y los objetivos, sigue siendo un desafío que no tienes por que ganar. Se convierte en un juego más parecido a lo que estamos acostumbrados a ver y jugar en este género. Conoces tus objetivos y como debes conseguirlos, y lo que no sabes es como se desarrollará la partida a causa de eventos, combates y equipo encontrado.  Para mi es un juegazo en ambos casos.

563837,arnora21,9,"Viciante al máximo. Para ser un juego de cartas transmite de una manera genial la sensación de ir resolviendo un misterio y explorando nuevas localizaciones.  Los mapas tienen variantes generadas al azar para que no sean siempre lo mismo. Aun así los desafíos no dependen tanto de conocer el mapa o la forma optima de resolver el misterio ya que hay encuentros al azar, cambios en el mapa y la constante de que tu personaje (o baraja) no es siempre la misma. Además, la campaña tiene variantes en función de tus acciones en las misiones anteriores con lo que siempre hay posibilidad de hacer las cosas de otra manera para ver que sucede y/o sacarte finales diferentes.  Y hablo de decisiones en plan ""Haces caso al consejo del misterioso personaje y quemas tu casa... o no confías en el y la dejas como está?""  Es un juego al que siempre tengo ganas de jugar. A dos jugadores va genial y andas ahí estrujándote el cerebro todo el rato para ver como os podéis ayudar el uno al otro o como conseguir determinados objetivos de la manera más rápida y eficaz.

I don't think I'll ever give it a 9 again, but it's a very solid 7.

6472,arod324,10,"Update #2 - Logged about 5 solo plays, 2 of them with the Vassal Engine and this game gets even better!  This is my favorite game to play solo and with an online version, I can do it while on the road and don't need 2 tables to play the game :-D.  I think it is definitely best played with 1-2 players.  Updated to a 10!   Update #1 - Played one more game solo and it was fantastic. Going to move it to a 9, pending 10 on replay-ability and then multi-player games.  I feel like I may not like the competitive world, but the co-op would be fun.  I love Vlaada Chvatil so much, but unfortunately I think that it suffers from three main problems  #1 Runaway leader #2 Complexity of rules #3 Time to play",96848,Mage Knight Board Game
20590,arod324,10,"Can Vlaada ever do anything wrong?  This game is pure genius who has done a variety of other mechanics.    I would call this a ""Gamer's Party Game"".  You have to meta the crowd and think about what they might know and be very creative with clues to gain tempo on the other team.  Updated 11/9: Moved to 10.  After more replays, it is apparent that this game is a hit and everyone enjoys it.  Another side benefit is that people can hop in/out of the game while waiting for a ""meatier"" game.  It is almost always being played at our board game nights at any given time.  ",178900,Codenames
81688,arod324,10,"Lots of subtle decisions, yet there is never lots of AP and the large screw-factor like in Puerto Rico.  I still love PR, but I would rather get in 3 games of Race than one game of PR.  ",28143,Race for the Galaxy
162218,arod324,10,"57 sessions in (46 unique scenarios): Still going strong and so many of the new characters are really awesome.  Some of the ""kill everything"" missions are somewhat repetitive, but with new characters and party compositions, it is super super fun.  Just went through a scenario where 1/2 of the monsters are available on any given turn (phase in/out of existence).  27 sessions in (24 unqiue scenarios): Upgraded to 10/10.  I can't stop thinking about this game and want to play it more and more.  Four characters are now retired and 5 unlocked characters (took 13, 22, 20, and 19 games to retire each character respectively). Depending on some of the goals, party make up, and other factors like which missions are available, there can be wide ranges in how long it takes to retire your character. There are lots of variations in terms of classes and different play styles and look forward to trying more!   14 sessions in (11 unique scenarios): Playing with the lower variance version (2X and 0X treated as +0).  This is a game that I keep on thinking about.  Could I have played it different and what combos do I want to put into my deck for X type of threat vs. Y type of threat?  We have only unlocked envelope B and two side scenarios.  I can't wait until we unlock the Power of Enhancement and new classes (no one has retired yet).    It plays extremely well with 3 and 4, but is a bit longer with 4, especially when there are lots of little monsters or NPC allies fighting with you.  With 3 you can get a scenario done in 1:30-2:00 fairly easily.    Minor Issues: I wish there was a better way to mitigate some of the monster attack draws.  In one scenario we had 4 of monster X summon a monster Y each the turn they were revealed.  They then had the same action the very next turn and also proceeded to start healing them.  After the first batch, it was pretty much unwinnable and when we did it a second time we breezed through it.    2 Sessions in: Initially an 8, but strong potential to go up after more sessions. I've been itching to play it and thinking of all the strategies and card combos while not playing it.  Will be playing with the less randomness variation in the future as the 2X and null have a very large impact and prefer the more tactical approach.",174430,Gloomhaven

I think it ranks above Agricola for the following reasons:  #1 The occupation cards give a lot of variation and mean that people have to read so many of those cards (read - too many options).  Not to mention that they are not necessarily balanced, so to mitigate that you would have to draft  #2 The expeditions make the game less tight, and that is good.  The expeditions allow you to do a ""grab bag"" of miscellaneous resources and can alleviate the issues of not having 1-2 of the exact resource you neeed  #3 The game's theme is more interesting than just a few farmers.",102794,Caverna: The Cave Farmers

Self-correcting play, where the leader is at a disadvantage.  Newbies have as good a shot as experienced players. 4.  High player interaction - even though there is little direct confrontation, everyone is competing for the same scarce resources - territory, markets, etc.  Minimizes downtime because you need to watch what others are doing. 5.  Unique and elegant mechanisms make this a different game each time.",2651,Power Grid

Since the card trade-ins have a built-in escalation mechanism, you should be able to secure a win with 30+ armies to deploy.  I have never played a game of Risk that was more than three hours.  The game has some bad features, namely that Australia is optimal to hold early, there is player elimination, and that there's just a tad too much luck.  However, this is a classic game with a lot going for it.  I think, like Monopoly, this gets a bad rap because most people don't really know how to play it.",181,Risk

Currently my favourite faction is the Nordic kingdom, but all are fun to play and they are all pretty balanced. The combo of farming and combat makes it increasingly strategic and is great if you want to build up your engine slowly or if you want to ruthlessly attack your opponents (black is best though). My one kinda question about the game is if encountering is worth it at all. Also I think that the different player mats are a little unfair, just going first doesn’t give you a huge advantage but still the other mats give so much more. I would still highly recommend if your into gaming and want a new game that is a good one. Hope everyone enjoys it as much as I did.",169786,Scythe

Vowed to play more of it, but between our game group growing (meaning less 2 player games) and other new stuff, this went on the shelf.  Well, went to game night last night and only one other person showed.  Happened to have this in my bag, just in case.  We broke it out and re-familiarized ourselves with the rules.  Played through and WOW, what a great game.  Why have I not played this sooner?  Even though the other player took control of resources, blue cards and coin generation.  I had a lock on the reserves, so I could buy what I wanted.  Any my military was monster.  So, by the third age, as my opponent started taking over science, it really was the showdown of an enlighted, huge thriving city versus the small import-only military complex.  It came down to the last face down card draw in age three.  Two cards, me one space away from military victory, even though I was the clear loser in every other facet.  50/50 shot, I choose and flip the card....  and it's a blue card.  OUCH!  Final score, 74 to 48.  I got trounced, but loved every minute of the matchup.  That, my friend, is a great game.  Get it.  Update, liked this game so much, I went and got the Broken Token organizer for this one.  It has become the latest go-to for my girlfriend and I.  We are really enjoying it.  Updated 1/6/20:  Got the home grown Leaders expansion and had it printed through an online print company.  It adds a nice layer to an already rich experience.  The last game played, I had access to no resource cards, but I was able to pull out the victory by going after the blue cards.  What a delightful game, a must own.",173346,7 Wonders Duel

My only gripe is that sometimes that end is revealed before actual completion when you realize you won't catch your opponent.  But, the exercise to get there was enjoyable.",148949,Istanbul

361061,ArsLoqui,9,"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu Rl'yeh wgah'nagl fhtagn!  RPG-lite. Arkham Horror inspired me to devour a ""best of"" Lovecraft's literature, so it's neat to come back to the game knowing the story behind the characters and locations. I initially rated this game a 10; in short, it is amazing. However, as I'm learning strategies to ""beat"" it, I find myself less and less inclined to pull it out with people who've played it before.  House rules we use to toughen things up:  1) Take the Elder Signs out of the unique item deck. 2) Two monsters appear at each new gate. 3) Gates are placed face down. 4) Raise the terror level by 1 every time a monster takes to the skies. 5) If a gate appears on a sealed location, the seal is broken. 6) Investigators CAN NOT trade items and spells at the beginning of or during combat with the Great Old One. 7) Investigators make a Sanity Roll at the beginning of combat with the Great Old One using the GOO's combat modifier and the Sanity Roll modifier. Any investigator failing this check immediately discards half of their items, spells, and allies.  8) During battle with the Great Old One, investigators' special non-combat abilities may be used only once and only if no attack is taken on that turn.",15987,Arkham Horror

In eliminating the collectible aspect and balance issues between sets by purchasing a whole block's worth of cards to use as a common card pool for all players, I've fallen head over heels for Magic again. I like the Lorwyn/Shadowmoor block best, too, with its storybook fantasy setting and the tribal nature of the cards - you get Faerie decks, Goblins, Giants, Treefolk, Merfolk, Elves, Elementals, etc., so the theme even feels a lot more cohesive.

668321,Arsultar,10,"Most thematic game on its topic. Its a very interesting game design, which catches the cold war theme extremely well and offers a lot of strategical choices. On its basic its a really a mix of hand management and area of Control throughout the game, which has these incredible moments of bluffing and guessing what your opponent has on his hand and what his next moves are. There is a small minor point to this game, which is the the nessecity of knowing the cards as good as humanly possible. For the first games you may play cards in a way where it might seem useful, but the lack of knowledge of specific cards effect might screw you over (like putting a lot of influence as USSR into Japan and later in the game ""Japan Mutual pact"" event is played and cost you like 2 turns from previous turns, because USA immidiately regains control of Japan due to its effect). Some may mention, that the longer play time might be an issue, but i cant see that as a problem personally, because the theme as well as the game mechanics themselves are so catchy, that you absolutely lose your feeling for time.  Last but not least is the concern of some people, that TS is pretty luck dependand. I can't fully agree on that. Yes Coups and realignements have some sort of luck, because of the nature of dice (even tho you can guess the equity of succes/failure, but these are sometimes risky plays and the quantity of these moves are pretty much capped by the DEFCON Track. So i would personally say, that out of the 156 Cards or so played, no more then 15-25 coups will be played throughout the game. I highly suggest to get the Deluxe version, because of the better Balance due to the new Cards. ",12333,Twilight Struggle

I would suggest this game should be played with a minimum of 5 players (although you will need to own at least one expansion for this to work out well) as the lower the number of players, the more personal people seem to take curses etc. With larger numbers, more people get cursed and Wandering Monstered and thus your players see it more as part of the ethos of the game and not a personal attack on them.

We have played it non-stop since the school year ended. 8 games in 4 days--one of them with 7 players, mostly first-timers! Insane, but so fun. There is such a satisfying combination of decisions and variables to take in every game. Some of its charm is intangible, since there is nothing terribly innovative about the mechanics themselves, but Jamey has hit a home run with this one! Can't wait to play again.",169786,Scythe

210678,aruhsenberger,10,"Talk about a card game, wow.  Race for the Galaxy is amazing.  In the age of deck building economy games trumping all (Dominion), this game shines as a counter example of true brilliance.  It is like San Jaun, only better.  The game is mad with a ""build your own economy"" theme and loads up on the quirky strategy.  The art and cards will easily make you a fan boy/girl too, they are goofy and inspiring.  The one problem: mind numbingly hard to learn, really.  The symbols on the cards could not be more confusing, however once you 'get it', things start to go smoother.  Warning: this may take three or more games, don't give up!  It is worth it.  Lucky for me, the amazing card art and story kept me plugging away at it till I learned.  Complex goodness it has.

Part of me was worried about the potential limitations of not having a board, but after a few games, I figured out, Hive skillfully uses this disadvantage as part of its strategies.  While simple, complexity arrises from its ability to be adaptable, with lots of interesting piece movements, which add flavor and variation.  And the ability for the player to customize his own games.  Small parts, big game!",2655,Hive
596513,aruhsenberger,9,"Simple and bold.  Ticket to ride is like Rummy with trains.  While the gameplay hardly paves any roads unpaved, it just does everything so well, and you can't help but love it.  Even though the Rummy style gameplay, with matching train colors is not representative at all to the theme.  The overall thought process, when playing, is.  Players take on tickets to link far away cities for big points, and other players battle to be the first to lay track on certain routes.  The coordination of all this equals a brilliant game, the whole family can play.",9209,Ticket to Ride
798165,aruhsenberger,8,"RK knows the gamers thrills, and he hits the sweet spot once again for me on this 2-player card game.  While the game isn't much to behold on paper, it becomes much more addicting in real life.  The games go by so quick, and that irrefutable human itch to balance and weigh points and risk, is scratched well, thank you.  However once worn, I am not sure I feel as if it was life-changingly innovative.  It seems to follow the rules all too well, I need this game to be more wild and funky, with some character to impress me up to a 10.",50,Lost Cities

207003,Arvale,8.5,I liked already Fordidden Island. Especially in a relaxed gaming round or for a solitair game with 2 or 3 characters.  ___________________ \_______GER_______/ Mit gefällt die verbotene Insel (vor allem in entspanter Runde oder im Solomodus) sehr gut. Daher habe ich vom Nachfolger ähnlich Gutes erwartet und bin nicht enttäuscht worden. Sehr schöne Umsetzung vom Wüstenthema und etwas komplexere Spielmechanik als die verbotene Insel.,136063,Forbidden Desert
231173,Arvale,8.5,"nice solo game ___________________ \_______GER_______/ Mit der Familie Weihnachten 2012 gespielt (Mitspieler von 8 bis 85) sehr gutes Einsteigerspiel für Koop! Der Nichte (8) hat es sehr gut gefallen. Die Karten und die Figuren sind sehr hübsch und unterstützen die Spielatmosphäre. Am Anfang auch noch auf Anfängerlevel überflutet worden. Dann hat sich aber doch sehr schnell ein Gefühl für das erfolgreiche Vorgehen eingestellt. Durch verschiedenen Insel Layouts und verschärften Startbedingung (höherer Startflutlevel) kann man das Spiel auch öfters spielen ohne das die Herausforderung fehlt. Ich bin mir sicher, das es sicherlich noch häufiger aus dem Regal kommt zum (Ein-)Spielen für ein Koop-Spiel und ganz sicher als Solospiel. ",65244,Forbidden Island

490529,Arvale,8.5,"Very enjoyable 2 player game. Easy to teach and to play. Normally it takes 3 rounds to identify the winner. Naturally some luck is involved by drawing of the cards but that is ok. Components looks good and colorful cards. The camels are funny to look at (look out for the Panda). A little bit fiddly for the setup. But with some routine it takes not too much time to sort the pieces. Especially if both player help. I gave it already 2 times as a small present. ___________________ \_______GER_______/ Das Spiel ist neuen Mitspielern schnell erklärt. Da es sich schnell aufbauen lässt und sich auch schnell ein paar mal hintereinander spielen lässt, kommt es bei Wenigspielern bisher sehr gut an. Die direkte Konfrontation ist relativ gering; natürlich kann man seinem Mitspieler ab und zu eine gute Karte wegschnappen aber auf die Dauer bringt einem das nicht zwangsläufig den Sieg und daher muss man sich vor allem um seine eigenen Verkäufe kümmern um sich die Gunst des Kalifen zu verdienen. Wenn beide Spieler einige Spiuele gespielt haben ist das Ergebnis im Allgemeinen ziemlich ausgeglichen, d.h. jeder hat eine faire Chance zu gewinnen.",54043,Jaipur

I gave it already 3 times as a small present. ___________________ \_______GER_______/ Ich war etwas skeptisch, ob ein Spiel mit nur 16 Karten Spass machen kann. Aber nachdem ersten vollständigen Spiel zu zweit war mein Interesse geweckt. Bei den folgenden Spielen zu dritt war mir dann schenll deutlich geworden, dass in diesen 16 Karten eine Menge Spass stecken. Das Spiel ist sehr schnell erklärt, am Besten neue Mitspieler gar nicht lange mit Erklärungen quälen sondern einfach einmal offen vorspielen, danach kann es direkt losgehen. Ich bin mir sicher, das dieses Spiel häufiger auf den Tisch kommen wird. Dazu laden auch die schönen und grossen Karten ein.",129622,Love Letter
770426,Arvale,8,"For some times a did not dare to buy the games because it is a very abstract 2 player strategy game (like chess or go which are both not my pice of cake...). But user Kaluga convinced me to try it out and I am glad he did! Hive is a very enjoyable game, which is easy to teach and to play. It looks very interesting and the components are of great quality (both the full and the pocket version). There are some nice expansions available (Ladybug and Mosquito which are already included in the Pocket version). The latest expansion is the Pillbug (got it from Essen 2013 for both versions).  I am still a beginner and I believe a professional would play me in the ground but as long as the two player are of similar experience there is a lot of fun. The setup time is extremely short (maybe 30 seconds). And it needs only 10 to 20 minutes to play it therefore it could be played several times in a row. See also my comments for Hive Pocket the travel edition.. Plays count for both versions. ___________________ \_______GER_______/ Ich hatte lange einen großen Bogen um dieses Spiel gemacht, da ich dieses abstrakte Spiel zu sehr in der Nähe von Schach und Go gesehen hatte. Erst die massiven Empfehlungen von Kaluga hat mich dazu bewogen mir Hive zu kaufen. Und ich habe es nicht bereut: Diese Reiseversion ist wirklich sehr schön, praktisch und vollständig.  Die Stein sind nicht zu klein und leicht und können immer noch sicher im Freien zum Spielen verwendet werden. Durch das insgesamt geringe Gewicht und dem schönen Säcken kann man das Spiel überall mit hinnehmen (auch in den Urlaub oder zur Arbeit). Im Gegensatz zur großen Version sind in der Reiseversion schon der Marienkäfer und der Muskito enthalten. Das Spiel spielt sich schnell (bisher 10 bis 15 Minuten). Die Regeln sind einfach. Und man kann schnell mit dem Spielen anfangen. Gegn Profis sieht man wahrscheinlich genau so alt aus wie beim Schach oder Go aber hier macht es mir nicht so viel aus, da ein Spiel sehr kurz ist.  Was mir als Hive-Anfänger jedoch besonders Spaß macht ist das gemeinsame Erlernen des Spiels mit anderen Anfängern.    ",2655,Hive

974474,Arvale,8,"Very enjoyable enhanced version of Yatzee with monster characters. Played it with players of age from 8 to 85 with a lot of fun. The Panda and Haloween expansions are funny but not really needed.  ___________________ \_______GER_______/ Das Spiel ist ja schon einfach gestrickt, aber es macht einfach eine Menge Spaß mit seinem Monster entweder die 20 Ruhmespunkte zu erreichen oder einfach alle anderen Monster in die See vor Tokyo zu versenken. Eigentlich hat das Spiel allen Mitspielern bisher Spaß gemacht (Familie von 8 bis 85 Jahren; wobei das hohe Alter sogar fast gewonnen hätte wenn nicht eine monströs unfaire  Wiederbelebungskarte einem schon scheintoten Monster am Ende noch den Sieg ermöglich hätte ...). Nur Spieler die das Spiel etwas zu Ernst nehmen und dem Würfeln im Allgemeinen mit Argwohn begegnen haben weniger Spaß an diesem Spiel. Das Thema hatte jedenfalls bisher noch niemanden vom Mitspielen abgehalten. Und in einer Runde von 3 bis 6 Spielern hatten wir unseren Spaß gehabt. Für einen ganzen Spieleabend reicht es natürlich nicht aber zum Anfang oder Ende eine lustige Sache.  Da mir das Grundspiel schon gut gefallen hat, musste das Pandamonster aus der Erweiterung [thing=127067]Power Up![/thing] dann unbedingt auch noch dazu... Der Panda hat totales Niedlichkeitspotential und wird sicherlich gerne als Hauptfigur ausgewählt werden. Die Mutationskarten geben extra taktische Möglichkeiten die das Spiel wieder etwas weiter vom einfachen Kniffel entfernen. Ob man diese Erweiterung unbedingt haben muß, ist eine andere Sache (also unbedingt sicherlich nicht, aber schaden kann es auch nicht).",70323,King of Tokyo
984517,Arvale,8.5,"___________________ \_______GER_______/ Die US-Version mit Spaß bei Frank gespielt. Die Europa-Version gefällt mir aber noch besser. Die Tunnel und Fähren sind zusätzliche Herausforderungen und die Bahnhöfe geben extra Möglichkeiten um doch noch etwas realisieren zu können, was einem die lieben Mitspieler eigentlich schon verbaut hatten. Durch die Bahnhöfe und den vielen Möglichkeiten mit alternativen oder parallelen Routen (wenn manchmal auch durch unwegsame Tunnel) doch noch seine Tickets einlösen zu können, ist ""Europa"" besonders familien- und anfängertauglich.

I would consider buying a copy if I moved away or possibly later to play with my boys.    Easily the top played game for me of 2018/2019.  It was the only game in my 2018 10x10 that I completed, and then continued to play for a total of 20+ plays in 2018.  Finally after 25 or so sessions retired my first character and we have retired and unlocked only 4 characters of the unlockable characters so far.  Play this still at least monthly.  If given the chance to play this or to have our regularly scheduled game night, I might choose Gloomhaven first. (2-23-19)  No more Gloom in Gloomhaven for us.  There are still branches of the story that we haven't completed, but the main quest line is done.  I ended up only retiring two characters - Cragheart and Three Spears with Moon/Eclipse as my third character after the defeat of the final confrontation retired Three Spears (defeat 4 bosses life quest).

You just need to forget all human decency for half an hour or so. Just fantastic.   One of my favorite CAH games was the one we played with our friend's very proper, middle-aged mother. She was aghast at her first couple card draws, but in no time at all, she threw down the nastiest card each round! Hilarious! I guess you never know what kind of naughty fun hides beneath someone's just-so veneer.",50381,Cards Against Humanity

It feels like a storybook filled with discoveries and treasures and monsters to kill, AND it can be played cooperatively! *swoon*   There are so many things to do on every turn, so many ways to accomplish your goals. And even if things don't work out as planned/desired, there are other ways to move forward. What else? Oh, yes: I love the artwork. One caveat: the mana ""crystals"" in the box are cheap and ugly, but I bought my own and now I'm happy.   Mage Knight is fairly complex and it did take me a while to learn how to play, but the effort definitely paid off. I can't get enough of this game.

632182,Asdnart,9,"This is the best adventure game, hands down.  It lacks the chaos commonly found in the genre, which allows for medium to long term planning.  While the gameplay can be a little bit like solving a series of puzzles and not like adventuring around the countryside, the mechanics never fail to create an interesting set of puzzles to solve.  Strategic questions (i.e. what cards to add to your deck) nicely complement the turn-to-turn cardplay decisions.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game

As a bonus, victory points are granted at the whim of randomly chosen (before the game) tiles, and the things you do for points often do not align very well with the things you need to do to grow your economy.  At the moment I think this is wonderful, but I worry that it's actually just a parsing problem disguised as a game with meaningful decisions.  I'm having fun parsing though, even after a dozen plays.  Much of the game is front-loaded, with a pre-first turn plan needed as to which scoring bonuses you plan to hit and when.",120677,Terra Mystica
862196,Asdnart,8,"A great game -- it's quite simple but it remains very deep.  I really enjoy the scoring mechanic that forces you to play for balance.  More confrontational than most games, which keeps things interesting.  I would rate it higher, but the theme feels a bit pasted-on, and as a more abstract game, the randomness in the tile draws can be frustrating.",42,Tigris & Euphrates

When I finally played the game I was amazed at not just how well it captured the feel of the show, but how innovative and compelling the game was in it's own right. It plays best with 5+ players, and avoids feeling bogged down with so many players by being extremely social. It's one of my favorite games of all time. ",37111,Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game

655164,Ash1138,7,"Tsuro is the best filler game I own. You can play it in 15 minutes. You can teach it in about one minute. You can play with two player or as many as eight. It's simple enough for kids to play, yet engaging for adults. The game board is small, and there is virtually no set up time making it a solid choice for taking to your local cafe or coffee shop.",16992,Tsuro

1001126,Ash1138,8,"It's so easy to dismiss this as a stodgy old WWII war game. It's so not. The fact that it's made by Days of Wonder should be a big clue to this. Memoir 44 is an extremely fast playing tactical strategy game with a WWII theme that almost feels like a card game. It feels like a light game because it's so easy to learn, with simple mechanics that make it accessible to new gamers, but there is a very satisfactory amount of depth. There is quite a bit of luck involved, but it fits the theme and makes you feel more like a general dealing with the chaos of war. If you are typically adverse to war games, you should try this game out. ",10630,Memoir '44

808627,ashermarx,8.1,"Star Realms really surprised me. I had only heard it in passing in a Rahdo review before someone bringing out their set at Kingdom Con. I love Dominion & deck builders and always am willing to try a new one. I thought that this felt like a lot of games already, like Ascension with its multiple currencies and how you buy new cards from the common pool pulled off the big deck and Legendary with its chaining of hero power activations. The life total and attacking people directly with one of the currencies felt fresh enough that it stood out. The game also has space stations which act as buffers that have to be attacked first or add special abilities. All in all I had a great time and really enjoyed the multiplayer variants. We did 2-headed (2 on 2) and a variant where you only attacked to the right; both lots of fun. The game is also cheap enough (~$16?) that I'll definitely be picking up a copy. My criticisms is that the number of ships available often feel very limiting where there is typically only one or two real choices to be made and later in the game your deck is mostly playing itself as you draw (which is a criticism of any deckbuilder but I felt it here more than most). This automation may be worse with repeated plays, but I definitely had fun while I was playing it. ",147020,Star Realms

Some may decry the miniature price (about $15 for each fighter), but I would argue that those that complain, either don't care about the aesthetics of their game, or don't value their time (it would take me at least an hour to assemble, prime, paint, and seal a ship to the above-average quality at which these miniatures come out of the box).  I wouldn't say it is the best gaming experience in any one area (tactical depth, theme, aesthetics, etc.), but if all these categories were combined into a boardgame decathlon then X-Wing would be best overall game by finishing in the top-5 in several areas.",103885,Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game

Playing online app is a bit predictable so I prefer live-action with all the cards and bits. The ""Coke"" cashing-in is controversial...3 francs versus 5?  I think a group decision.  Can't really break out that rule for new players, though, they should experience the problem first on their own. ",35677,Le Havre

It’s one of those games that you can play friendly but sometime you just have to deny your opponent what they need because, well, you need it more or you just want to sabotage their quilt making business!   It’s truly hard to get upset if you lose this game, even if your opponent is purposely trying to sabotage you. In the end, you made a quilt. Sometimes it’s a better quilt than the winners but you just didn’t make enough money to make the quilt worth making. -------- Take turns buying quilt patches to fill up your quilt outline. At first it seems easy, but then when the selection of patches dwindle, so does the possibilities of placing them on your quilt! In order to buy patches you have to have earned buttons “money” to buy them. You start off with a certain amount of buttons at the beginning and during the game you will get patches that will gain you residual income during certain phases of the game. In order to win the game you subtract the number of empty spaces on your quilt outline and subtract that from the number of buttons you currently have in your position.

12096,asimpkins,10,Rating based on one play.,28143,Race for the Galaxy
52618,asimpkins,10,"A really great theme very well implemented in the game mechanisms and the cards.  This is a top notch heavy two player game.    Many heavy two player games are standard war games involving armies and such.  This is nice twist on the idea because while there are some abstracted wars, it's really a clash of influence and control of countries.  The one drawback is that you really need to learn the many cards pretty well to play competently, and if one player knows the cards better than another then that's a huge advantage.  But that's not that big of a deal.  It's worth working through.",12333,Twilight Struggle
179683,asimpkins,10,"One of the first modern games I played and it's a really good one.  It's famous enough that it probably doesn't need me to say much about it.  The nearly luckless pieces all fit together really well with lots of different choices offered -- primarily but not exclusively in the role selection.  Players can also follow different strategies to victory, using the different abilities offered by a variety of buildings.  After playing it a lot, I haven't played it in a long time as I've explored other games.  I'm curious if it will drop to a '9' when I revisit it.",3076,Puerto Rico

348505,asimpkins,9,"I really enjoyed my only play of Vinci, and this new version was just as good.  Not only are the core mechanics fun, but they're also fairly unique.  There are two things to like here.    The first is the nice assortment of races and special abilities and how they randomly combine to create a wide variety of options.  Some are better than others, but the auction system keeps it fair.  The other is the decision of when to put your current civilization in decline and start again with a new one.  Not only is this timing on this a tricky call to make, it has the added bonus of letting to switch over to a completely different civilization and approach the board in an entirely new way.  The rules are also surprisingly simple and it make this game a comparably easy game to learn.  We did make the mistake of playing with 5 players though.  It's still a fun game, but this lead to too much downtime.",40692,Small World

361062,asimpkins,9,"This is one of my best purchases because it fills a unique niche pretty well.  It's a complex cooperative game that supports a good range of players with lots of chrome -- items, abilities, spells, monsters, locations, events, etc.  There are a few small downsides from all that complexity and chrome.  The first is that one person needs to learn the rules very well to help run things.  The second is that it isn't a flawless engine -- sometimes you might have to tweak things to get them working right.  Overall, I haven't found either to be that big of a problem.",15987,Arkham Horror
649331,asimpkins,8,"Someone has to take the time to go online and get all the revised rules and scenarios and learn everything so that they can run the game for everyone else.  But beyond that this is a great purchase because it's so unique as a cooperative exploration games that suddenly drops a random scenario and pits one of the players against the others on some novel task.  It's not very competitive and there's not much strategy.  The fun comes in finding out what's going to happen and then doing what you can to get by it.  I've only played it twice, and I suspect that some of the scenarios can occasionally fizzle.  But it doesn't take that long to play, so it seems worth the chance.",10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill
657898,asimpkins,9,"Rating based on one play.  Played this two player and it nicely fills the medium two player spot between really light card games and heavy war games.  Each round you roll dice and then have to figure out how best to spend them.  This prevents the game from getting too heavy with long term planning and analysis.  You certainly need to set some general short and long term goals, but you have to stay flexible.",84876,The Castles of Burgundy
659008,asimpkins,8,"A great light-weight cooperative game.  The limits on communication and knowledge do a great job of addressing the problem of one player dominating a cooperative game and telling everyone else what to do.  You can talk some strategy between games, but otherwise all players need to make their own decisions each turn -- and each turn is important.  If there's a weakness, it's that the goal of the game isn't too exciting.  You're trying to get as many points as possible, so it lacks the tension of other cooperative game as to whether you'll pull off a victory or not.  ",98778,Hanabi

66487,Asmoridin,10,"I was a fan of the original CCG Netrunner.  This game kept the core of the original, but added several balancing touches (non-blind traces being a big one).  I personally like the addition of the identities, and the cleanup of the card design (and the update to the art).  It's an asymmetrical, non-randomly collectible card game with elements of bluffing, risk taking, and just great gameplay.  Couldn't ask for more out of a game.",124742,Android: Netrunner
112132,Asmoridin,10,"I didn't appreciate this game that much when I first played it, but after spending days thinking about what I could've done better, I really enjoy it.  It's got a very solid theme embedded into it, with plenty of tense strategic choices to make throughout the course of the entire game.  Seems fairly well balanced (I just suck).  Would love to get more games of this in.",12333,Twilight Struggle

456608,Asmoridin,8,"Great game.  A good combination of strategy, luck (only in card draws), and pure chaos.  Plus, the game scales really well.  2 player games are alright, but the more players, the more chaos, and the more chances you get to mess with other people.",18,RoboRally
558310,Asmoridin,9,"This was very enjoyable.  It felt like a more complicated (not necessarily more difficult to play, but there was more going on) version of San Juan, but I think it plays a LOT better, and is really very fun to play.  I, of course, tried for the straight military 'Rebel Crushing' victory, which didn't quite pan out, but I enjoyed every second of it!",28143,Race for the Galaxy

605465,Asmoridin,7,"Easy to learn, easy to teach (I was quoted 15 minutes, and was taught in all of 3, haha).  It's pretty fun, but I think it'd really be more fun with more than 2 players.  2 players was a pretty good time though, so I'd recommend it =).

619455,Asmoridin,8,"The girlfriend LOVES this game, which is a big plus for me (as she rarely likes or will play anything).  She'll even bring it up to me just randomly to play.    Outside of her, I would think this game is still pretty good, but probably not AS good.  A lot of it seems to be timing, as well as some risk vs. reward management.  You could hold cards in your hand until you're 100% sure you'll make a profit.  Or you could risk it, put down some investments, and hope for a good payout.    And of course, the theme is wholly pasted on, but I guess that's pretty expected.",50,Lost Cities

1037775,Asmoridin,8,"I had a negative review of this game for some time, but I think a more moderate one is more accurate.  The mechanics are not difficult to learn, and the gameplay is generally smooth.  The collectible aspect (and the frequency of new sets) makes serious play pretty restrictive price-wise.  I don't find constructed play terribly fun these days, especially with competitive players who spend a lot more money on the game than I have any inclination to do, but I LOVE drafts.  I think every Magic player (even casual) should give them a try.  A TREMENDOUS amount of fun, and generally not expensive (friends can do it for the cost of a few packs).  Lately, I've discovered Commander.  Let me tell you- that alone is worth playing this game for :)",463,Magic: The Gathering

Somehow it does not feel abstract when you are playing it. I think it has something to do with the beautiful art and quick but satisfying gameplay. Also you get to stack your thick chips in front of you and gloat over your ever-growing gem production. As for player interaction, the game ends up feeling pretty brutal at times, as players start stealing cards and nobles that they knew other players were about to get.

578243,Asperamanca,9,"My initial thoughts were that this is a very well thought out engine-building game with beautiful cards, but more or less multiplayer solitaire.  It took me six games just to start appreciating the possibilities the phase selection has for player interaction, and to get a glimpse on different possible strategies.  As an example, take two 2-player games with my GF:  In the first game, I started with New Sparta (military world), and tried out a card-acquiring strategy (that is, get as many cards into my hands as quickly as possible, then see what I can do with them). I got an alien world pretty early (=goods I can exchange into many cards), and went with a military strategy that scored my 40 points and a clear victory.  In the second game, I started with Old Earth, which made it more interesting for me to produce and consume goods for VPs. However, I had some cheap but nice developments on hand that I hoped would help me later in the game (they gave me extra cards in development phases). As it turned out, I didn't play a single development after that, so those cards were wasted. Still, I had a good time settling worlds, and got a nice little production-consumption engine running. I ended the game by using up the VP chips, and ended up with 46 VPs, 6 more than in my previous military-oriented game. As it turned out, my GF, with a mixed military-production strategy got to 49 VPs!  One thing I noticed is that I had to select ""Production"" twice, to produce goods on windfall worlds. My GF with production worlds profited from that. Another thing was that I used up goods for cards (lots of cards at least, but still), while my GF went ""Consume 2x VPs"" pretty early. I also would ""Settle"" very often (had a +2 on non-military worlds development), and my GF used those phases to settle cheap production or military worlds. Using the other player's phases really can make a difference between winning and losing!  In summary:  PROS: +) Nice, colorful and well-illustrated cards +) A symbol system that takes some getting used to, but once you know it, you know at a glance what a card will do for you +) A good engine-building game, with a feeling of growth and achievement +) Different strategies can yield good results +) Subtle player interactions, that can still make a difference +) The fact that cards can be used in two ways (as the card itself, and as generic ""money"") strongly reduces the problem of ""card luck"" - every card you draw is valuable, even if only to pay for other cards.  CONS: -) No direct interaction between players, which turns off a lot of my friends -) Only up to 4 players (but there are expansions...) -) Some card luck is involved, especially whether you draw a good 6-point development that fits your tableau and yields you lots of VPs (that alone can make the difference between winning and losing in a tight game).

146339,assbinator,10,"Excellent use of exploration mechanics, Nice combat mechanics that allows you to modify your ships to fit the threats or attacks you are about to make. Good feel, it recreates the theme very well.  Some races are a bit more powerful than others, but very manageable.  One thing that everybody would agree is that it take WAY too long to setup, and it needs a BIG table to play due to the exploration tiles being so big.  If it weren't for that I would gladly give it a 10.  It plays good with 3-5 players.  Turns take a little bit long due to the strategic shifting of the game (you could have one strategy but it might change as soon as you see one of your opponents building ships or maybe making alliances).  One game could possibly take 3-4 hours, but I will guarantee that it will be a lot of tension and its extremely hard to get the ""Runaway leader"" effect.  Highly recommended for regular board gamers.  If you are a casual gamer, I would give it a chance but I warn you that it takes a long time to play and a long time to setup, so be PATIENT (the game is worth it).  The price it a little bit to high for casual gamers, but for veteran gamers its perfect, due to the amount of pieces this game had.  The races in the game are nice, and even if you just play humans all the time it seems that every race has its own theme.  Before you completely say NO to this game I highly suggest you play it with 3 players.",72125,Eclipse

Playing as a Cylon and watching the humans unravel whilst trying to sow seeds of discontent is just too much fun to have in one game.

DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME if you are not comfortable with the entire result resting on a single die roll!  This has happened to me in a couple of games and it is very very annoying but oh so fantastically tense and exciting. This game holds ever so true to it's theme.

Bought my own copy and have had a few games and now that I understand a bit more it is enjoyable. Good fun but sooooo hard even on easy. Looking forward to the first win  Way Hey! We've had some wins, and have now moved to the normal difficulty. Even harder but still do-able with a bit of luck and timing. Heroic: one game so far and we were trounced. But we WILL get there!  We have got there! 2 player game win on Heroic, and there was much rejoycing.  We can now usually win on Heroic barring a really bad card draw. Can't wait for the expansion",30549,Pandemic

132426,astalis,10,"First of all i dont give 10s easily. Its the 4th one, after Pandemic legacy, Cosmic encounter and Kemet. All for different reasons.  Why 10? -Value for money. I am not sure this game provided any profit to Isaac himself. Seriously 100 euros for this 10 kgs box with the plethora of items it includes, its a joke. -Its a legacy game, and its a legacy game that can be played again. Not sure if i ever make it to the end, but giving you the option to reset it seems great to me. -Great battle system. Card combos are there but its very crucial to use them wisely and dont lose the cards early. Very smart.  -The different characters do feel very different. Their playstyles are not similar with each other and feel very thematic. -Absence of dice.  -Its very close to Mage knight, except that it lasts 3 hours less. I love Mage knight too, dont mistake me, but Gloomhaven its more appealing with its shorter play time and legacy features implemented. -The attention to detail in this game is amazing. Road and city events, personal quests etc etc , these stuff could be missing and still Gloomhaven would be great. But Isaac just wanted to make the best board game ever, and he probably achieved it. -This board game comes as close and it gets to an rpg video game. I ve played many rpgs on the past and i can clearly see that.  *I dont think i can find any negative in this game. The only thing that  its a bit annoying is that all these components give me hard time settle them back in the box after finishing the game.    *Bought plano box for standees + additional box for map tiles.  *Painted minis  *Added painted furniture  *Bought health and xp dials.  *Bought removable stickers",174430,Gloomhaven

There are many paths to victory which is also very good. The haters of it, accuse it for its high luck factor and its broken combos. Luck factor is there, yes, but when the 70% of the games out there have dice, you cant really whine about luck in this game. As for the combos, at first it may look like it, but then you realize that there are many different powerful combinations which eventually balance the game.   *Update: After multiple plays, i liked this game even more and i increased its rating.

97215,Astey,10,"I've only played a couple of two-player games so far, but I'm really digging this game. Setup only takes a couple of minutes if you sorted the pieces right in your last tear-down, and everything is so tactile. The tiles for planets/developments feel great, the dice are fun to roll, the plastic dice cups are solid and not flimsy, and you're pretty much always doing something.   There were a couple of rounds where one of us finished quickly and the other was still placing their dice, so there might be some downtime between quick players waiting.  Some see this as a downside, but I see it as time to either talk to other players or read up on the abilities your planets or developments give you.  My first two games lasted 40 and 20 minutes, with the latter a ""rush to end conditions"" from one player that ended up being a lot of fun.  My only gripe is the rulebook. As someone who's never played Race for the Galaxy, it took a couple of YouTube tutorials to figure out how to actually play this game. The gameplay itself is pretty simple, but the rulebook was a confusing mess on my first read-through. I'm going to try to find a cheat sheet to help me explain the rules to new players.  First impression: This game is on my list of favorites. I'll update my review after a few more playthroughs if anything changes, but, so far, I'd highly recommend it.",132531,Roll for the Galaxy
353988,Astey,10,"Reviews of Mage Knight are common, but a few of my friends asked me to share my thoughts on the game. So, here they are! I'll update this review after a few more games, if I feel it's necessary. I'll mostly be talking about the *feel* of the game, which I don't expect to change.  This review is for gamers newish to the tabletop scene who are interested in diving headfirst into something complex and magical.  **First Impressions**  Mage Knight is a heavy game. The first thing you'll see when you open the box are two rulebooks - One is a walkthrough, the other is a reference guide. Both seem pretty great, but they're a little confusing when it comes to combat. I recommend printing off a few of the guides from the BGG Files page for quick reference.  The introductory walkthrough does a great job of helping you set up the game step-by-step. It introduces the mechanics to you *as they come along*, instead of all at once up front. You don't even draw some of the cards you can eventually buy until you reveal a certain tile in the first game, so there's that much less to wrap your head around.  **Components**  The game has four minis for your heroes and four minis for the cities you discover in the game. The cities are neat, but the heroes are *rad*. The paint and figure quality on the heroes is spectacular.  The monster tokens are cardboard punch-out tokens, *but* they're already punched and in a nice little plastic tray with a clear plastic lid for storage. They have a good enough weight and feel to them, and they're easy to place onto and remove from the board.  The hex tiles feel about as solid as any Twilight Imperium or Catan piecies.  Everything fits in the box *just so*, with no extra room for cards to shift around. Note, if you sleeve your cards, they won't fit in the insert.  **Gameplay**  It's awesome, but it's complex as hell. The gameplay is fun, it takes forever, and it's intense. When you figure out how to overcome an obstacle with the resources you have, it feels like you just finished a puzzle. Scraping by a monster by the skin of your teeth at the beginning of the game makes smashing strong enemies with powerful abilities later in the game *incredibly* satisfying.  It feels like an adventure RPG video game mixed with a tabletop D&D session and a deckbuilder card game.  **Time**  I played the ""First Reconnaisance"" mission, the walkthrough scenario, over the course of three days. I was able to leave the game set out on our dining room table, and it was easy to pick up and play for an hour or so each day.  This is a game you'll need to set aside a big chunk of time for a full scenario, at least a few hours. I've heard that each added player (up to four) significantly increases playtime.  **Experience as a new player**  I just barely beat the introductory scenario, which is focused on exploration and teaching you the mechanics of the game.   The rampaging enemies were tough to beat at the beginning of the game, but I managed to defeat two enemies at once while exploring ruins by the final round. This game gives you a real sense of progression, as you add stronger cards to your deck and more units to your command.  I ended up with one movement tile still unexplored, and I hadn't found The City yet. I had just exhausted the dummy player's deck, which meant the game was over at the end of my turn. I managed to use the last of my resources and my last available unit to discover the final tile and reveal The City.   I spent around ten minutes putting the cards and pieces back in the spots and set the box on the shelf. I already want to take down the box again and start my next adventure.  **Thoughts**  If you like fantasy-themed video games and books, if you like tabletop games like Dungeons and Dragons or Twilight Imperium, and if you have a great deal of patience; I recommend this game.   I paid around $65 after shipping from an online store, and a local game store has it in stock for about $80. After my first playthrough, I think $80 would have been a reasonable price for the game. I can already tell it's going to give me hours, maybe days, of enjoyment. I'm looking forward to sharing the game with my friends, and I look forward to rainy days at home with this game sprawled across my table.  ------------------------------  FIRST REVIEW This game is flippin' gorgeous. The minis, the tiles, the cards, everything looks and feels solid. Even the rulebooks feel like they're printed on high-quality paper, and there are two of 'em! A walkthrough for the first playthrough, and a rulebook for reference.  I started the tutorial mission, and my confidence in the size of my table wilted with each newly placed component. This game has a sprawl factor, I think.  I'll write a full review once I've got a few plays under my belt, but so far - This game seems amazing.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game

897902,Astey,8,"This is one of my favorite games to play with five or six people. The rounds are quick, and when people really get into it, it's an absolute blast.  I've lost count of the times I've heard friends - and new strangers at conventions - say things like ""As the Duke of Duke-ington, I will collect my taxes from you poor fools,"" only to be countered by someone saying ""Ah ha, good sir, but, you see, I am the Duke of Duke-ington, and I do not believe you hold that title!""  It's fun. You should play it. The rules take some explaining, but any questions are usually cleared up by the end of the first round.",131357,Coup

Simple rules that are very easy to teach, plays fast, no downtime, a fun theme that everyone can enjoy, and great artwork.  This game actually does a better job than 7 Wonders at encouraging players to deny their opponents points.",133473,Sushi Go!
18404,AsTheDuke,10,"This might be the best cooperative game out there. It has the right level of difficulty and has plenty of things to think about. The theme is tied so well into the gameplay. Everything about it is so clever, from the shifting sands slider puzzle to discovering the coordinates of the ships' missing pieces.  It builds upon the mechanics of Pandemic and Forbidden Island but deserves its own spot in anyone's collection.",136063,Forbidden Desert
33918,AsTheDuke,10,"A great hidden role, bluffing game that works well in any size group with both gamers and non-gamers. While in most hidden role games, you are forced to play as the character you are dealt whether you like it or not, in this game, it doesn't even matter what you are dealt because you can play as whatever you want. The game is as interesting as you choose to make it. You choose how risky you want to play and you create the tension.  Easy to teach with simple rules; has player elimination but plays fast.",131357,Coup
54729,AsTheDuke,10,"The simplicity of mancala, but rich with options, decisions, and strategy. Perfectly balanced game that has ended with very close final scores in all the games I've played so far. Beautiful presentation.  You can't really plan ahead too much because by the time it's your turn, the board can be radically different. This could be a problem for some players and can create a bit of analysis paralysis, but it hasn't been much of a problem yet.",157354,Five Tribes
92481,AsTheDuke,10,"Excellent semi-cooperative game in which players have to balance the needs of the colony with their own secret objective. These questionable intentions lead to added tension between players, who never know who to trust with a potential traitor among the group. The Crossroads cards add so many tension on each turn, and the stories really pull you into this world.   Great theme that is incorporated well into gameplay. Adjustable difficulty level. No alpha player problem because everyone has to look out for themselves in order to win.",150376,Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game
187408,AsTheDuke,9,"A very unique puzzle that plays really smoothly and surprisingly fast. The game is about being efficient with your movements and finding a circuit that gains you resources and money, while picking your workers back up. There are many paths to victory. Players can have very different strategies and still be neck and neck at the end. Gameplay matches the theme really well, and the artwork is delightful.  The only thing I dislike is that near the end of the game, players can see who has won and how many turns it will take for him to finish. For that reason, it can be anticlimatic as players helplessly watch someone win when they can't do anything about it.",148949,Istanbul
268234,AsTheDuke,10,Great classic game that plays well at all player counts and good with gamers and non-gamers. The game is so simple but still gives the players interesting strategic decisions on each turn.  Deceptively cutthroat - no greater feeling than driving a road straight into your opponents' unfinished city or kicking your opponent out of a giant farm late in the game.,822,Carcassonne
268489,AsTheDuke,10,"Civilization style game that incorporates military, science, trade, culture, resources, and wonders all into just 30 minutes that can play up to seven players. Pure genius.  Simultaneous play makes for little downtime. Plenty of strategy and inner debating on whether a card can make it back to you. The only downside is it's difficult to teach this game to new players.",68448,7 Wonders
311618,AsTheDuke,9,"This game is just fun; exploration is fun, the story is fun, the theme is fun. Sure the game may have balance issues and some of the scenarios aren't nearly as fun as others. But it's understandable because of the infinite ways one of 50 haunts can start.  Some games end anticlimactically. Others get into frustrating dice battles that go on for four hours. But when the stars align, you get an incredible experience that becomes one of the most enjoyable and most memorable moments in gaming I've ever had.",10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill
415875,AsTheDuke,8,"A refreshing new take on the Action Programming mechanic in which you can divert from your original plan if needed. This is the kind of game where the more chaotic it is, the more fun it becomes. Strongly thematic. Great for both gamers and non-gamers.  The game is a little bit fiddly, with a lot of moving parts and cards. I'm also a little disappointed with the component quality. My locomotive was very loose, though none of the other train cars had any problems.",158899,Colt Express
620490,AsTheDuke,9,"An excellent cooperative game drenched in theme that is incorporated nicely into gameplay. I absolutely love that choices you make early in the game that give you short-term benefits can come back to haunt you later. Those cards really bring you into this world, make you feel engaged, and add so much flavor to the story.",121921,Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island
687581,AsTheDuke,9,"Simple, streamlined worker placement game with just the right level of complexity and strategy. The bonuses on quest cards create for some really interesting card combos. There's tons of player interactions with intrigue cards and building owner bonuses.  It also comes with the best box insert I've ever seen.",110327,Lords of Waterdeep
927046,AsTheDuke,8,"A great blend of trading, set collection, and hand management. Great social player interactions, works really well with large groups, and doesn't really slow down with more players. Donations add a really interesting element to the game. Simple and elegant.",11,Bohnanza
952033,AsTheDuke,7,"Fast, light filler that plays great in a large group and is really easy to teach.   I'd imagine that this game would be amazing if played with the right crowd. The game unfortunately has become very repetitive for me since players never change it up to make things more interesting. It'd be better if the game encouraged bluffing a bit more.  Recommend playing with the variant where miners that have broken tools when the gold is found don't get any gold. It adds a more semi-cooperative feel to the game and leads to fun backstabbing amongst miners.",9220,Saboteur
985556,AsTheDuke,9,"Excellent, well-designed game with multiple paths to victory, tons of options and strategy, and so much to think about yet not overly complex.   The game does a good job of adding a little bit of randomness, but allowing players to control their luck by changing dice rolls with workers. Each game board gives players the challenging decisions of placing tiles to both complete regions for points and open up options for future building. The game is balanced with all tiles having some sort of benefit.",84876,The Castles of Burgundy
996840,AsTheDuke,8,"Great two-player set collection game that brings so many tough decisions as you debate whether to hold out for the cards you need and wonder if you are setting up your opponent.

There are others as well but you get the idea.  On your turn you move your stack of workers dropping off or picking up a worker at the last tile and performing the tiles ability.  I have yet to play a game of this where I didn't have fun even if I lost.",148949,Istanbul
588057,Astral_Complex,9,"I would have given this a 10 as it is a fantastic abstract game but I dropped it to a 9 due to the fact that I could see one issue.  It will get old after a few plays and I could see it essentially sitting on the shelf collecting dust eventually.  With that said, this game is purely fantastic.  You are a spanish tile layer and you earn victory points by placing tiles on your board.  First one to complete a horizontal row triggers the last round game end.  Looking at this initially I had no interest.  It looked too simplistic in nature.  Over lunch one day a buddy asked if I wanted to play it so I figured I would give it a shot.  I bought it that very night.  It plays well at all player counts (2-4 players) and I couldn't suggest this game more.  If you like abstracts this is a definite must own game.",230802,Azul

780107,Astral_Complex,8,This is a solid entry into the lighter gateway games in my opinion and I really enjoy the first player mechanism in it.  Essentially you are just using dominos with terrains on them to build out your kingdom.  With a few stipulations of course.  Only a 5x5 grid and when placing a terrain must match at least one of the terrains it is touching.  ,204583,Kingdomino

927353,Astral_Complex,8,One of my favorite two player only games.  There are five different colors and each color has cards labeled 1-9 with three multiplier cards for each color as well.  Object is to stack the cards sequentially (starting with a multipliers if you want to risk it) and at the end of the draw stack you tally your scores.  Here is the kicker though.  You score negative points if you have a stack that has less than 20 points in it.  Each stack you subtract 20 from to get the final score.  That's to keep you from just placing in each color and to make it more complex.  It's mathy but fun.,50,Lost Cities

1024495,Astral_Complex,9,"This has quickly risen to one of my favorite two player only games.  Three different ways to win.  Science, military, or victory points.  Trying to think of how I would describe this one.  It is played over three rounds.  During setup you and your opponent draft four wonders each that you can build during the course of the game.  Of the eight wonders in play only seven can be built.  So, if you build all four of your wonders that makes it so your opponent can only build three.  Then you set up the cards you draft.  These cards vary from cards that give resources, cards that make resources cheaper, straight up victory points, military strength, science, and a few others as well.  You go back and forth drafting cards.  When you draft a card you can put it in front of you for use, discard it to gain two coins (plus a coin per yellow card you have drafted in front of you) or you can use it to build a wonder.  The play in this game is pretty tight.  Score wise there never seems to be someone that totally runs away with the game.  All in all it is a great game that deserves a spot in anyone's game collection.",173346,7 Wonders Duel

470015,Astrofaes,10,Challenging but never unfair. This is a game that both demands and deserves commitment and it'll constantly reward you for giving it your all.  Update: I've played 25 scenarios over 60-70 hours. I just retired and unlocked my first class. It feels like I've just scratched the surface.  My rating of 10/10 stands. This is the best solo and co-op game I've ever played. Perfectly balanced.,174430,Gloomhaven
708749,Astrofaes,9,"After 800+ hours of playing Arkham Horror with all combinations of expansions I'll rate this at 9/10.  It's wonderfully random which makes no two games act out in the same way. It can actually be fun losing a game, which is a good thing since you'll be doing that a LOT.  +  Investigators and their background stories.   Some of the investigator abilities are a great deal of fun. Rex, Wendy and Hank comes to mind.  Artwork and components are of excellent quality.  Reading encounters are tense and fun as they often result in unexpected and hilarious outcomes.  The atmosphere is dense and fits the setting perfectly. This is an evil game in so many ways!  Fiddly in a good way. I much prefer this over the more streamlined approach in Eldritch Horror. Arkham Horror has you running around town and other dimensions collecting monster- and gate trophies. After a few hours of play your investigator carries the rewards and scars of your accomplishments. You become attached to your character.   After having played hundreds of scenarios the past four years we still play at least one scenario a week.   Deputy Dingby as a comic relief.   -  Sometimes it's a bit too random. You just won't know if you'll succeed at a check no matter how prepared you are. If you're really unlucky with the mythos cards the game will be over fairly quickly (or just keep going for 12 hours...) and there won't be anything you can do to stop it. We've lost at turn 2 against Cthulhu due to some bad gate spawns and monster movement in Innsmouth. We've also won against all odds by being extremely lucky in late game.  Some of the investigator are just bad due to a combination of bland abilities, low willpower and sanity and/or low movement. The personal quests (expansion) redeems some of the characters.   So. Many. Cards. Me and my wife decided to just buy a huge table and leave Arkham there at all times. That way we can get a game up and running whenever we feel like it. We once tore the game down and it took us half a year before we actually bothered to set it up again.

539615,astroglide,8,"This was one of my first gateway games. I liked it a lot, but it seemed to go over worse with every replay. With non-gamers in particular both the forced actions and the hand arrangement could prompt question after question. After a massive hiatus I played it with my family and it was a hit with the kiddos. Would always be happy to play with the right group (fast and friendly).",11,Bohnanza
589486,astroglide,8,"Very solid. On one hand, tough to not ""cheat."" On the other, this offers a nice dynamism for house-ruling around mixed groups to suit play styles. I played the tile version, which was pleasantly tactile. Cards may be more usable, but annoying to hold.",98778,Hanabi
609512,astroglide,8,"Simple rules, nice look and feel.  Games are often tense and the decisions have a nice illusion of greater control.  Not very apt to suggest it, but I think it deserves its success and reputation as a great game for couples.",50,Lost Cities
671628,astroglide,8,"starting player advantage and unforgiving of mixed skill levels.  other than that, what's to really fault?  i don't like that element either, but lots of games reward rote memorization and i think superior fundamentals can still fade the need.  timeless game which promotes all kinds of good thought processes.  it can be handmade or bought cheaply and played just about anywhere with just about anyone, over and over and over.  i like www.instantchess.com for quick web-based games.",171,Chess
781069,astroglide,5,"I don't think this is nearly as awful as its BGG criticism would indicate.  My preferred way to play would be 4P, by the rules (no free parking bonus, use of auctions) with an unofficial turn order variant (no buys until you pass go once) and the official game ending variant (game ends after the second bankruptcy).  Played like that, with gamers, I think it could be okay.",1406,Monopoly
928878,astroglide,6,"i had only played pared-down bbs variants of this, never played the real game.  i played the real game online recently, and i think it's unfairly maligned among gamers.  many things that are said about it seem true, but does that mean it's not fun?",181,Risk
970076,astroglide,8,"Revisited this one after a multi-year hiatus, after I fell in love with Agricola.  The only complaint I really have is downtime: downtime with players, and reverse-funnel decision expansion with turns getting slower as the game progresses.  You can play around that with 2-3 fast players, though, and it is possible to RIP through a 3P game with motivated players.  Overall, I can conclude that this one has stood the test of time for me.  Made me peek back at the iOS implementation, whose UI I still unfortunately hate.",18602,Caylus

I always have a great time playing, even when I get blasted out of the sky.",31481,Galaxy Trucker

Even if it's not your turn, there's plenty of opportunity to get engaged.  A wonderful game.",39463,Cosmic Encounter

The gameplay is easy enough, probably a little too easy...the rules, on the other hand, are kind of confusing to follow.  It may be better with more players, but I'm not that interested in finding out.  EDIT: I'll leave up my initial impressions, but now that I've played it with four, I'll up my rating a bit.  As a filler, it's great - short and simple.  As long as you're not expecting a really deep experience, it's fine.",16992,Tsuro

912618,asutbone,8,"Highly strategic and in-your-face game.  I like it...you can definitely see why this one has stood the test of time.  The mechanics are very smooth, the card powers are pretty well balanced, and the strategy is pretty complex.  You really need to see the board as a whole when going for regions, rather than just focusing in one place.  It's not a game I would want to play often, nor is it one I think I could get many of my friends to enjoy, but it is definitely a good one.",93,El Grande
918910,asutbone,8,"Very solid addition to Dominion.  It's nice that it plays as its own game, but it loses points for being packaged as such.  Some of us who got the original don't necessarily want to purchase the whole set again.",40834,Dominion: Intrigue
954465,asutbone,8,"It's a very interesting, if a very confrontational game.  The mechanics are nice - I particularly like that you still earn points when your race is done.

I'd probably get this for myself if I thought I'd ever be able to play it.",15987,Arkham Horror
1010636,asutbone,8,"A good strategic game.  I definitely like it better than Agricola because, though there are still a lot of decisions, I don't feel so overwhelmed.  I like the short turns, and though the game lasts a while, it moves very quickly.",35677,Le Havre

56538,athedegaard,10,"I never played the original Netrunner, and then played this with a friend who was much more excited to try it than I was.  I actually hated my first game - a lot of unintuitive mechanics and jargon, and a overall feeling of helplessness from some terrible rules explanation.  Then, I was reading the rules afterward: ""What, you mean scoring agendas doesn't clear the server of all cards, including ICE? And I can install ICE on an empty server?""  (Like I said, really bad rules explanation)  Then actually went out and bought it, having hated my first game.  Love it, it really is a great game once you play it right.  Still got a pretty high learning barrier, but overcoming that, you'll find an asymmetric card game that is highly strategic and shockingly well balanced.  Playable out of the box with only one set with workable prebuilt decks and sensible card distribution (though I want more Corporate Troubleshooters...), which is better than diving in to deck building right away.",124742,Android: Netrunner
403797,athedegaard,9,"Saying ""may the best player win!"" prior to a game of CE makes about as much sense as building a wood-burning stove out of paper.

The game met my expectations. - Mechanics: I love the mechanics, the numbers of actions possible, the strategies to compete against your opponent.  - Material: The material is of a very high quality. Some games are delivered with standard or low quality and we never mention it. I want to highlight the high quality of the Five Tribes components. - Rules: easy to understand even tho there are a lot to remember. We gradually assimilate then and everything becomes smooth. - Players interactions: Through the assassinations and tiles controls I would say it is moderate, but enough to make the game intriguing and to have some friendly tension to take control of the city ! - Theme : The desert / Oriental theme is well incorporated with the mechanics / components. It's not too flashy, not too neutral. Enjoyable ! - Conclusion: I had very high expectations for Five Tribes, and wanted it for 6 months. My first 2 games where a bit slow because of the learning process but I really enjoy the gameplay, the components, discovering strategies... It will come back on our table very often !

I don't think I have completed any of the games I've played without making several mistakes along the way ... that isn't a bad thing about the game ... just a consequence of its complexity, and it will take some time and several games to get to play it right, and it can be a bit frustrating at first ... either way ... I like it very much!!   Edit: My Mage Knight box came with no mana dice.

638971,atomheartmother,10,"I finished the entire campaign playing solo (three characters) in under 5 months. That is how addicting this game is. The first play was on 1/21 and the last on 6/16. It took a mere 212 hours and 25 minutes to complete over the course of 72 plays (66 scenarios with five losses/repeats and one repeat to complete a life goal).   To be completely honest, that only counted the time between the start of the first round and the end of the last round for any given scenario. If I kept track of the time spent doing in-between scenario stuff (events, shopping, leveling up/creating characters) along with minimal setup/cleanup, it’d be more like 260 hours. Plus the 10 hours it took to punch, sort, study the rules, and reset the game at the end. So, yeah—it’s a good value.   And a good game. A great game. A masterpiece. The best game ever designed. I can’t begin to comprehend the mind that created this delicate monstrosity of a game. Nor can I fathom what it would take for a game to knock this out as the pinnacle of game design. I’ve never played such an utterly captivating game. It sunk its claws in and wouldn’t let up until it was finished.   The mechanics of the game—both in-scenario mechanics and overworld mechanics—are a thing of art. Brilliant. The rich, unique, and varied world created by Isaac is the icing on the cake. I don’t particularly care for high fantasy, but I cared deeply for the world he created and everything in it. I’ll miss it.   Although no game is perfect (I even have a few very minor quibbles with some mechanics that maybe could use some tiny fleshing out), this game is as close as it gets. Thus, the closing is bittersweet. I’ll miss the world, but I’m glad to have a “normal” life back. And a now empty table that’s been otherwise occupied by this game for the last five months.   This game is so utterly magnificent that I needed to drop the few other games I’ve rated a 10 down to 9.9.",174430,Gloomhaven

Works equally well as a 2,3 or 4 player game ... have not tried 5 yet.  Even though it is a turn based, the downtime can be spent planning your next move, and once you get the hang of it, turns are taken very quickly.  The 'double-action' bonus cards are very powerful. Can be a base of your strategy.  When playing just the base game we include the Wainwright from 'Istanbul: Mocha & Baksheesh' and all the non-expansion specific bonus cards (like turn a die to 6 etc.)  Playing with both expansions (great bazar) usually makes for a quicker game (which you would not think), though the setup takes a bit longer.

We use all tiles for 2,3 and 4 players: 2 player - 7*7 3 player - you use the 4 extra tiles to create 'sun-beams' on the center of each side. 4 player -  regular 5*5  Plays: 200+",204583,Kingdomino

More specifically, it's the kind of game that fans of studying game design will get a kick out of as every single alien species breaks the rules and reshapes them for an entirely new experience.  The game is absurd and takes itself only as seriously as the players feel like taking it.

The only thing that can get annoying is flipping flooded tiles over, especially when there are pawns on them, only to flip them back over the next turn. We've modified our game to include tokens that you put on top of flooded tiles. Only downside to this is it's sometimes hard to get a full scope of the situation of the board as the underside of the tiles are easier to see than a token. It's really not that big of a deal, I'm just lazy. I wouldn't let any of what I've said deter me from recommending it to anyone, especially couples. This was the first board game I was able to get my wife to play as she's not a fan of one vs one games and it's normally just the two of us. It says 2-4 players but this can very easily be played solo if you're so inclined. Just make sure you play a couple characters or you'll find it very difficult to win.",65244,Forbidden Island

113945,atos25,10,"Amazing, complex, highly thematic - never felt the struggle for survival so alive! (oh, no, it's a double snow cloud, now I will freeze and then starve to death...)  What makes this game truly amazing is its replayability and variability. First of all, playing the same scenario twice is never the same due to all the random events, items, etc. Second and most importantly, there are tons of different scenarios, each providing a completely different gameplay. And it's not only the ""official"" scenarios, but all the fan-based scenarios as well, some true gems among them!",121921,Robinson Crusoe: Adventures on the Cursed Island

This probably won't get played very often in our house until the kids are old enough to get it into the 3 or more players range.",93,El Grande

96159,Atotalnutt,10,"Outstanding!  If you like Puerto Rico you'll probably enjoy this too.  If there's a part of your brain that enjoys really analyzing your options and picking the most ideal based on a flexible mixture of strategy and tactics, this is for you.",18602,Caylus
140530,Atotalnutt,10,"This game is incredible.  The resource market is so much fun to manipulate.  I haven't even had a chance to play the full game, but that sounds like a blast.  I guess heavy Euros must be right up my alley.",2651,Power Grid
172260,Atotalnutt,9,"Tons of fun no matter how many people are playing - my wife and I enjoy the two-player version very much.  If I could own only one Rosenberg game, this one would probably beat Agricola.  The two player game can be hammered out in about 20-30 minutes and is still something our 'go to' when we want something fast and familiar.",11,Bohnanza

I anticipate liking this more and more as I become familiar with the different cards and potential combos.",28143,Race for the Galaxy
834614,Atotalnutt,9,"Won this in the G4GG Summer Secret Santa!  I enjoy civilization building as a theme, and this game really captures that feeling while maintaining a concise playing time. I like how the game abstracts a board by making each player worry only about the civilizations to their right and left.  Not so great with two players, as my wife and I have discovered, but I'm very glad to have this around for when people are over and when the kids get old enough to play it!",68448,7 Wonders
1018296,Atotalnutt,6,"Good way to teach area control to kids.  Not bad if playing with 2 or 3 players, or if you stop playing after someone gets eliminated.  With too many players it's too long for the amount of game you get.",181,Risk

Over time i am sure this will be a 10 as more items and content are released.  Excellent components. Playing first test game today.  After two plays, intro scenario,  Overlord 1 heroes 1.  Search is harder, witnessed the knockout syndrome issue but was manageable due to healer in party.  Feels like Descent but Different and this is good as it will have a place on my shelf and i think this will be a favorite of my wife's.

Especially that the characters gain levels and abilities is a very nice part of the game. The material (a multitude of cards, thick plates and miniatures) is also very nice.  Only reason it has missed 10 stars for me is the duration of a turn; if another player ponders his move thorougly it can easily take 20 minutes.",96848,Mage Knight Board Game

For two, the endgame with two players remaining has ""lame duck"" problem where one of the players just can't win.  But, the game manages to be thinky and interesting while somehow being in the same genre of Love Letter (in terms of weight and play time).  This is SO MUCH BETTER than Love Letter.  Also better than Lost Legacy.  Currently this is fresh but Red7 is not.  Not sure if this beats Red7.",131357,Coup

But, I want to play Hive with kids someday.   ==2019/02/02== Hive is a really, really good game for specific people.  Tim M just clicked with Hive tonight, but not Exceed.  The ""different pieces have different movement rules"" thing scratches the Chess-like itch, and the other abstracts I'm looking at don't do that.  I like abstracts best in a friendly environment when you can tell your opponent ""That was a bad move; did you want to take that back?"".  When I played with Noah, he was too competitive and refused to let me take back obviously stupid moves.   ==2018/09/04== I don't actually play Hive a lot, but the game is so small that I'm okay with keeping it forever.  I wouldn't be so tolerant of a bigger game.   ==2017/11/07== Hive is a great game that I don't want to play.  The laborious consideration of each move for minutes and minutes makes the game drag on.  A single game of Hive (when played well) is very satisfying, but leaves me drained afterward.  I usually need at least a month before I'll even consider playing it again.  One user made a magnetic set to be hung on a wall, so that he and his SO could play-by-email the game.  That might be the best way to offset the analysis paralysis that this game requires.",2655,Hive
1031311,attackofmilk,8,"[2p, abstract]  Favorite game to play with Robbie.  ==2019/03/30== Alison_Mandible's comment on ""loss by oops"" feels right here.  Either you do something stupid, or you force your opponent into an situation where they can't defend against your win.  I'm not sure how to force those situations yet, but I'm somewhat confident that I *could* learn if I played the game enough.  The character powers seem to give the game legs, however.  They should give the game new challenges to puzzle around, which will hopefully mitigate the solvability of the base game.   ==components== Spinmaster second edition feels cheap.  I would've loved the water at the base of the board, and the tarot-sized character cards were curved when they came out of the box.  I will probably purchase sleeves for the game, just to give the cards a little more thickness and durability.  (I also am planning on shuffling character cards to deal randomly, and I hate shuffling non-sleeved cards.)  Also, my first copy of the game was missing the domes, so I had to email customer support for replacement domes.  (They sent me a second in-shrink copy of the game instead.)",194655,Santorini

53153,Attika,10,"How difficult can it be to play, in ascending order, cards numbered from 1 to 5?  Pretty hard indeed when you don't get to look at your own cards, and clues to other players are limited to number or color, but not both!  A co-op card game with simple rules yet pretty deep gameplay, Hanabi requires a dedicated group to bring out all its nuances.  The more you play it, the better you become.  And since information isn't shared by all the players, it side-steps the ""alpha gamer"" syndrome of most co-op games.  Simply love the tight play, where you have to decide whether to give a clue, discard, or play.  And if you decide a clue must be given, then you have to decide to whom, and what clue will be most productive.  Tough with two players, better with three and more.  Simple, elegant, clever, and fast.  There simply isn't much more a game needs to be!  (A bit dry theme-wise.)",98778,Hanabi

Pretty sure I'm still screwing the rules up somehow, since it seems like every time I play I discover something else I'm doing wrong.   I fear that, as much as I like the game, the one thing it lacks is the opportunity for a newcomer to succeed. It's a game that rewards careful study, much like Chess, which I both admire and despise.

Games can swing wildly from one turn to the next depending on what's drawn. On the other hand, as I've played more I've found that the random element seems to be favoring me more and more, which tells me there's more to it than ""whoops, I drew the right 6-cost development! I win!""  Over the course of the week at WBC 2009, I went from not being particularly interested in the game to wanting to play it as much as I could. I wound up playing in the tournament and made the semifinals, winning three of my games in the qualifying heats and taking second in the fourth.  Short enough to squeeze in those times when we needed to kill some time waiting for someone's event to finish, but long enough to feel worthwhile (I'm looking at you, For Sale), I'm going to make sure to have this one handy whenever I travel with gaming friends.",28143,Race for the Galaxy

177117,Audacon,9,"Backed this on Kickstarter on a whim, but I am so glad I did.  This is a very fine abstract decked out in great visual form.  The elevated board is entirely unecessary, but it gives the game great aesthetics.  Game play is very fast to learn, but like all abstracts requires you to think ahead.  The artwork for the Greek gods is fantastic and very family friendly.  The wide variety of god duel options is very cool and it makes the replay of the game very high.  Production quality of the game is outstanding - really, really nicely made.  As a fan of abstract games, this one hits the mark very well.  Highly recommended.",194655,Santorini
365643,Audacon,9,A wonderfully dynamic area influence game.  Well balanced and full of strategic options and challenges.  Worthy of its high praise.  As for whether it is pure abstract or highly themed?  I vote for the latter.  [GTI Code: TPSD],42,Tigris & Euphrates
404936,Audacon,8,"A solid cooperative game with very good bits and presentation.  The introduction and possibility of a traitor makes this unlike other cooperative games.  Easy to draw players into the game.  For first time players, it may be best not to use the traitor, but it should be required in subsequent playings.  Card draws will impact the outcome and players will have to adjust to the situation.  Keep game play moving or the game will drag and take longer than desired.  [GTI Code: TGCL]",15062,Shadows over Camelot
490849,Audacon,8,"This game will either be a hit or a miss with a game group.  It's not really clear why, but I suspect it relates to the group dynamic and the player's ability to work with shared components.  In this game, the farmer and the panda are both shared elements in the game.  (For that matter, the board tiles and the bamboo are as well!)  And a player needs all of these to align in the right way to score points based on hidden objective cards.  If the other players 'don't cooperate' with your plans, you might not do so well.  But if you are flexible and adjust to the situation well, this game can be a great deal of light fun.  It will not be a brain-burner.  But it is not merely light fluff.  Observing and responding to the board's development is key.  If you miss this, it can feel chaotic.  If you get it, it will feel tactical.  Excellent components, visually appealing, and approachable (to some crowds) combine to make it a fine family game.",70919,Takenoko
605402,Audacon,7,"This is an interesting twist on the standard connection game in that the players are trying to make the longest run and thus keep themselves alive.  As a light game, it is odd to see player elimination.  This game handles it quite well, since the play time is so short no one feels left out for long.  A good filler / closer that will surprise many.  Just remember that there is a lot of luck in the tile draws.  Play it super quick for a board game that feels like the light cycles race in TRON (i.e. a game with 4 in under 5 minutes total.)  [GTI: AGCL]",16992,Tsuro
744392,Audacon,8,"Set aside nostalgia for a moment.  If this were a game about generic combat in space, would it be any good?  The surprising answer is yes.  The core mechanisms in the game are derived / lifted / borrowed from Wings of Glory.  Each ship has maneuvers that can be selected and a movement template that shows where the mini should end up.  The physical aspects of moving the ships is well thought out and works very well for the target audience (likely younger gamers).  And that's where you might think the game ends, but not so.  X-Wing combines a squad building and customization element into the game.  It is this customization and the rules framework (150 pt squads, 3' x 3' play area, etc) that really make this minis game shine.  When you add in the fact that you are playing with iconic star ships, you have a winner.  A solid and containable minis game that works well.  And that nostalgia... its not so bad either.",103885,Star Wars: X-Wing Miniatures Game
746622,Audacon,8.5,"I've 'sold' this game as the most strategic card game you'll ever play with only 16 cards.  And in fact, there are really only 8 cards if duplicates are not counted.  So what makes it work so well?  It's super simple to teach.  Easy to grasp.  Highly portable.  And game play is quick.  You can play a short or full game as time permits.  Another game for the Every Gamer's Travel Pack(tm) collection.  Just not so sure that all the monopoly-like clones are doing the original any benefits though.",129622,Love Letter
844059,Audacon,7,"A solid abstract game that can easily appeal to fans of Tetris.  The piece placement is considerable different though and that can throw players.  As the pieces of various players get closer to each other, it is easy to miss how a player can slide into a territory because the corner connection is what matters.  If not for the slightly unusual placement rules though the game is pretty run of the mill.  It plays quickly enough not to wear out its welcome.",2453,Blokus
916494,Audacon,7.5,"When cooperative games emerged, the trend was to develop advanced games for the gamers.  Game play increased as did complexity.  Then this game arrives on the scene.  Extremely approachable for gamers and non-gamers alike.  And able to be taught to younger players (my 4 y.o. likes this game!).  Add in game length appropriate to the game level and a fantastic price point and you get a winner.",65244,Forbidden Island
999896,Audacon,8,"This is a solid strategy game that presents the players with several options and approaches to take.  On any given turn you never feel that there is a 'correct' answer that should be followed, but are usually presented with several viable options to debate.  While some consider the game complex, it is really the interaction of the numerous elements that is complex. The game play is surprisingly easy.  It is definitely a game that favors players who have played before and have learned the various buildings.  A solid game if you are in the mood to wrap your brain around something. [GTI: TPSD]",18602,Caylus
1022766,Audacon,7,"This game can suffer terribly from Analysis Paralysis.  If the supercomputer is bored, do you really think it will take 5 minutes to plot out and program a robot's movement - incorrectly?  Not likely.  This game really needs a timer on the turns and house rules for incomplete programs (i.e. cards not played in time).  When its fast and furious, the game's underlieing humor emerges and we all enjoy watching Twonky race through the hazards with his 'firiends'.  [GTI Code: TGSD]",18,RoboRally
460590,AudaIbuTayi,9,"A lot of hidden role games have a lot of role-specific special abilities to keep track of.

67686,audpogue,10,"Clank! is one of the best games we own. Hands down, we have played this more times than any other game in our collection. We have taught this to almost all of our friends. This game follows the basic deck-builing guidelines where players start with a standard deck, and through gameplay will purchase more powerful cards to add to it. During your turn, you will cycle through your deck by drawing and playing cards in front of you. The cool thing about Clank! your cards let you move and explore around a board via boot icons. So, it's not just about buying and playing cards. The board depicts a dragon's lair, and we are the brave (stupid) souls who have decided to relieve her of her riches. Players will dive ever-deeper into the dungeon to steal ancient artifacts from the sleeping beast, but as you can imagine, burglary of precious jewels can be a bit noisy. She begins to wake up! Time's running  out, and now it's a race against your friends. Who will get away with the most valuable goods, and who will die trying? 9/10.",201808,Clank!: A Deck-Building Adventure
178013,audpogue,9,"I admit, Sagrada was an impulse purchase. I thought it was pretty. This is what ya get when girls play boardgames LOL! Thankfully, it's a solid game with simple mechanics and thoughtful strategy. This falls into the category of puzzle games - kinda like Blokus or Patchwork. You have a limited choice of pieces (dice in this case) and you must place as many dice as you can on your own player grid, while following placement restrictions. There are favor tokens that you can spend to help you throughout the game. It consists of 10 rounds of dice-drafting, so it is fairly quick. It scales nicely as well, since you simply roll less dice for less players. I'll always play when presented with opportunity. 8/10.",199561,Sagrada

Perhaps, not relevant, but totally makes sense if you know my brain - pretty, abstract, puzzle game with a short rule book. Easy to teach, challenging, and fun to play over and over again. Also, it scales very well depending on the number of players. 9/10.",230802,Azul

30785,audra1010,10,"My favorite aspect of this game is that no two plays are ever the same.  Especially with the two main expansion packs (Dames and Cursed!) there are enough race and power combos to keep it fresh.  Even if you see repeat combos, they do not play the same depending on the other races in play on the board.  We recently started playing with Tales & Legends as well, which adds an entirely new aspect of strategy to the game.  Some of the T&L cards force you to shift your strategy in a way that you would not have done otherwise.  I am a huge fan and cannot seem to get enough of this game.  I have the game for the iPad too and I wish it kept a tally of number of games played because my numbers would be through the roof.  The speed of the game in comparison to real life is a big plus.  One criticism of the iPad version, though, is with the limit of a 2 player game... and the speed... when you play as often as I do it tends to get a bit more redundant.  ",40692,Small World

I used to play Duel Masters with them and Kingdom Hearts because it was a great way to bond.  What I love about Dominion is that all players start on a level playing field so it is not just a competition of who lucked into a rare & powerful card find or who spent the most money buying card packs to fill their deck with the strongest cards.  This games lets everyone start from the same point and how you build your deck is entirely up to you.  ,36218,Dominion

The games I played so far had a very close neck-to-neck finale that was both breathtaking and incredibly involving. Mechanicaly this is a very simple straithforward design with my slight worry that the limited variety in the cards (undoubtly fixed by the expansions) might render the game samey in the long run, but so far almost no game comes close of generating such an intensity and interaction bar possibly TI3.

This was my favorite game for a long time because it always feels intense and dangerous.  The betrayal feels like betrayal because your task is difficult, but betrayal is also difficult (making this game more interesting than something like Battlestar Galactica).  I wish it was simpler and easier to get to the table, but every time I do I'm immensely happy I did.  Also, the game has deep storytelling and a beautiful cast of characters that makes almost anyone you get to play as exciting.  I'm very the game embraces diversity in a way that feels authentic to the actual diversity of people that would be surviving this kind of apocalypse.  Finally, I love that the winter itself feels like a threat as much as the zombies do, making this feel unique in a market saturated with zombie games.  ",150376,Dead of Winter: A Crossroads Game

Now that I've played the majority of the campaigns (and intend to keep playing all new content) I'll add that the game is very versatile and some of the campaigns are exceptional and exactly what I want in a board game experience.

The variable setup is intuitive and wonderful, the board beautiful, the player warehouse boards give it a tactile edge, and I don't really have much of an issue with the cover art work as many seem to do.

The zombies are rather 'one note' at this point, but they're not always the greatest threat if you've got a traitor in the mist.

With beautiful visual aesthetics and intuitive, easy to teach rules, T.I.M.E. stories is more or less an old school adventure video game given cardboard flesh and 2-4 player interaction. The mechanics themselves are fairly basic, with a neat die & token system for challenge resolution, but the fact you the insert of the box can also be used as a convenient SAVE STATE for unfinished missions is nothing short of astounding. The one thing it has going against it is that once you've gone through a Mission it won't offer you any surprise, but you can always play dumb so friends can enjoy it and make your own decisions randomly. Also, unlike Pandemic Legacy, you don't destroy the components, so you could lend it out to friends to enjoy while you await future Mission packs (which are a few dollars too pricey, I'll admit). The storytelling in 'Asylum' is quite good, so I can't wait for future scenarios and a possible meta-narrative to emerge.",146508,T.I.M.E Stories

I'd also argue that while I like the gameplay more in EH, this one feels more thematic since you're not exactly globetrotting but focusing in more like an actual Lovecraft story.

I think that getting the right draw of cards is significant in determining whether or not you're the winner, but more important is getting your food engine up and running.  This is a game which can appear daunting to people who have just played lighter games, but is fairly intuitive.  One of the nice things about this game is that it is a very strong 2 player game.  I play with my wife a lot, and she enjoys it as the flow seems to make sense and relate to how a farm would work.  After 13 plays I'm willing to concede that I may bump it up.  But I hate to bump it up, burn out, and then move it back down.  11/25/08 Bumped it up to a 9 as I'm playing this game a lot.  03/28/09 I think that I enjoy 5 players less than a fewer number of players. Seems as if card draws can weigh more heavily than skill in determining the winner.",31260,Agricola
27173,autumnweave,10,"10/6/16: Bumped up to a 10.  This game is a great experience and the best of its class.  8/13/2015: Bumped up from an 8 to a 9 because this still gets fairly regular play 3 years on in my gaming group.  3/28/12: The latest must have 'it' game.  A very nice space exploration game, and it does several things right.  Good production values, well playtested, and not rushed into production unlike so many other games these days.  In my opinion better than Twilight Imperium, which I consider overwrought.  Certainly faster paced that Twilight Imperium, but not a thematic game.  Like most civ building games, there is development of an economic engine under the hood, and I appreciate that more than the combat.  I do like the part of being able to customize your ships, and I'm starting to see that there is some skill in how you upgrade. I disagree with others that say this game ends too soon.  However I've got this nagging feeling that after the initial glow wears off, this will be a very good game, but not the end all game.  For me it's perhaps biased a little too much towards combat, though I won by avoiding combat.  This is a nit, but the colors for the 3 resources are a little too close together.  Rating more likely to go up than down.    One thing that has me nervous is that more than one battle has been decided by who could be the first to roll a 6 on their dice.  There is a moderate amount of luck in this game and you need to be comfortable with that.  Just starting to learn the differences in the races.  My perspective is that the Eridani are harder to play than the others.  Will have to spend more time with this.  Plays well with 4-6 players.  Played 5 players with 3 newbies in 4 hours.  A little concerned that in 5 players, the ones on the edge have the advantage.  With more players it can become a much more aggressive game due to limited resources.",72125,Eclipse

It's testament to the kind of tension this game can create when my partner dropped an f-bomb after a waters-rise card in front of our daughter, haha, oops!  When my daughter was not busy calling her mother out on her use of language she was super-fixated on getting the treasure and she really got right in to the story. Make sure you read out the scene-setting text at the beginning of the rule book to get eveyone in the mood.  Awesome looking figurines by the way - my daughter loved the crystal fire treasure and wanted to take it to school for 'News Day' - haha.  Probably not a game kids can play by themselves without a few adults to keep them on track, but if you're comfortable explaining all the options - good and bad - to the little ones AND letting them make their own choices, everyone is going to have a good time.",65244,Forbidden Island

85309,Averon,10,"I have played this game a ton and is one of my favorite games of all time.  The 10 rating is for the game with all expansions included.  On it's own, the base game is probably about an 8 with many of the expansions ranging from 7 to 8 themselves.  However, when you get a big game with everything included, this game is amazing!    It has a nice amount of roleplay and story elements along with a bit of character advancement.  The game is decently challenging, making each game intense and enjoyable.  I have played this game so many times, I have lost count (probably around 20 to 30 times).  I have started a game with friends to finish around 10:30 at night and we each look at one another and decide to play again, going until 2:30 in the morning.  I feel this is one of the best games to capture the Lovecraftian Universe.  Games take around 2 to 4 hours to play, depending on the scenario along with about 30 minutes of setup time (I can usually do it in 15 mins due to the organization system I have set up).  I have gone out and purchased card holders for this game to make management of card decks and set up times efficient.

I didn't even know that it was an official, published game--this was before I was even aware of designer board games, BGG, and all that jazz.  This game changed that.  I was blown away by how much intensity emerged from such a simple ruleset. As a spy, this game makes me set personal records for dirty, rotten lying.  Not the trivial kind of lying in poker, where you can simply stay quiet and let your chips do the talking.  You have to feign indignance when others accuse you of being a spy.  You have to fake delight when your spy brethren are backed into a corner.  Lots of people just can't stomach this intensity.  I view it as a valuable skillset--one that had lain dormant until I found this game.  The added roles in Avalon do improve the game slightly (although I hear there is an expansion to the sci-fi themed version that includes said roles and more.)  Perhaps even more than the roles, the Lady of the Lake is a very welcome addition, providing a nice amount of concrete evidence to supplement the gut feelings.  But really though, I will never turn down a game of resistance, in any of its incarnations.",128882,The Resistance: Avalon

When I play this game (as with most variable-player-power games) I prefer to let everyone pick their character.  I can see the strategy getting samey after more plays, but this still feels very fresh atm.  After three plays, I have yet to beat it on anything higher than novice difficulty.  Edit: Just CRUSHED this game 2p with climber + meteorologist on normal difficulty.  Almost full canteens and only 8 sand tiles on the board at the end.  I have a feeling that could have been a clean victory even on legendary.",136063,Forbidden Desert

70400,Avron,10,"My rating is for the family game. So far at least the ""gamer"" version with the mass of cards rates a little lower. I seem to be unable to keep all the possibilities straight in my head and don't really have a clue what best to do each turn, especially when the Occupations and Minor Improvements are in play.  2010-04 Even playing 2-player with someone that I taught I've failed to score well in almost any game. The intricacies seem to be beyond me.  2010-07 Now I've played (a lot) more I'm probably just as willing to play either version of the game. As long as the others have played the ""Family"" game at least once before.  2011-07 After teaching a few people to play the ""full"" version I'd still rather teach the ""Family"" game but if the new people are wanting everything I'll teach that way.  2017-7 This has now been my favourite game for about 5 years. I prefer to teach the family version so new players have the base understanding of how things work.  2017-12 I've been gifted the revised edition. My plays will likely be more often that version now.",31260,Agricola

Still don't think I'm good enough to need the expansion. 2014-10 I've played with boards from both the big expansions, and the Latest Models. I don't feel they're as difficult to deal with as others seem to. But I don't always do as well as I feel I ought to.",31481,Galaxy Trucker

There's an optional deck-building mechanic, or a recommended deck that is great for people just starting out or those who don't like deck-building.  Gameplay is challenging but winnable and even if you know where the story is headed, it's quite replayable due to the number of character decks you can make and their different abilities. The game mechanics are quite wonderful, too. Combat is easy to understand and the theme is a big part of the game.  Just a great game.

168784,Aweberman,8.5,"One of my first Euro/designer games, Blokus remains my favorite abstract strategy game.  When played by four people of at least competent skill levels, it can be a tense and tactical dogfight.  One knock on it would be the fact that one weak player can significantly sway the game, as playing badly and cutting yourself off leaves more room for maneuverability for the other players and, thus, less tension.  But this is only terribly relevant if you care much about the final score, and I rarely do.  Also worth noting is the fact that Blokus is really only ideal for the full four players.  The three-player version is a hack (all three players control the fourth color by turns); for a better three-player-specific Blokus game, see Blokus Trigon.  The two-player game (both players control two colors) works fine, but a better implementation is Travel Blokus/Blokus Duo, where the board is actually shrunk down and each player controls only one color.  That variant can be played on this board, as long as you have some way of arbitrarily assigning the necessary boundaries.  If you only intend to play two-player, though, you should get the smaller board instead.",2453,Blokus

Un jeu abstrait certes mais un mécanisme génial et totalement dans son thème, les insectes. La fourmi fonce, le scarabée grimpe mais se traîne, la sauterelle…saute. Une réussite indémodable pour ce grand classique pour 2 joueurs méconnu en dehors du monde du jeu. Personnellement je le préfère aux échecs : plus rapide, plus accessible, bien retors et toujours très varié : chaque départ de partie est différent et aucune mise en place, on joue immédiatement. Et quel plaisir de manipuler les pièces en bakélite ! 3 extensions existent : la coccinelle, le moustique et le cloporte. Amateurs de jeux abstraits pour 2, foncez si vous ne le possédez pas déjà, l’un de mes 10 meilleurs jeux jamais possédés depuis 15 ans ! ??-?? One of the best game for 2 ever made. I prefer it yo chess, that’s it. Ok, i’m not a good chess player ?Gorgeous tiles made of bakelite, clear rules, no set up, open the box and play. Theme successfully implemented is this abstract game. Ants go fast, beetles move up and down slowly, grasshoppers jump….it’s always pleasant to play hive, one year i bought it…in 6 copies to make presents. I prefer the « normal » size rather than the pocket one. Extensions adds 3 new insects. Ladybug is recommended to compete with beetles ability. One of my top 10 games ever played. ?? Une juego abstracto con tema fuerte. Muy fácil de entender, muy profundo, atractivo y produce mucha adicción. Consiste en unas piezas hexagonales que se mueven de maneras diferentes (cómo en el ajedrez). La partida se gana si se rodea a la Reina de la Colmena enemiga por completo. En ningún caso el grupo de bichos puede separarse. Cada partida es diferente dependiendo de con que ficha empieces ! No me canso jugar a Hive, más de 10 años después comprarlo, un « must have » por 2 jugadores !",2655,Hive

If I played a boardgame, it was Risk or Monopoly or some other American game which was okay, but nothing special.  This game though, perhaps more than any other, really introduced me to the idea of a different kind of game.  I was just looking for something I could play with two people, and more or less stumbled across it.

193247,Axtral,10,"An excellent hidden-traitor game based on the 2004 re-imagining of the classic 70s TV show.  The humans are fleeing the cylons and need to find a safe place before the game-controlled and secret cylons manage to destroy them. Though as in the series, no safe place is safe for long: each box (Base, Pegasus, Exodus and Daybreak) covers each of the four series respectively and each one adds exciting new mechanics into the game.  Highly recommended, though it may take a few games before your players are used to bluffing and spotting bluffs enough.  Be warned though: this game is brutal for the humans. We once played a three-player game where the only cylon card was not drawn and still lost, and a four-player game where the cylon mis-read his card and thought he was human, and we still lost. Out of all my games I have only seen the humans win three times. But we all still love the game and enjoy playing it regardless (and most of us are disappointed when we are cylons).",37111,Battlestar Galactica: The Board Game

Game too easy? Stop allowing a specific type of table talk or - if necessary - add in a rainbow suit variant.

Easy to learn, and loved the 'second guessing' of role choice, and choosing the right one vs what other people chose.

There's a 1/2 hour YouTube video which explained the mechanics extremely well.   The things I liked about this game were the quality components, the ease of play, the good mix of strategy and luck, the fast pace, the short duration, and the Euro style (which I'm new to), while maintaining a military aspect.   I'm a wargamer who so far has only been able to get new gamers to play Risk, cos it's most familiar.   But it can get cutthroat and can leave bad feelings.  I love that everyone stays in the game until the very end.  And I didn't even mind that I lost both times!  There seems to be endless replayability.   It played well with 5, but I can see how it would play just as well with 3-7, which is another really nice thing about this game, since many other games have a much narrower range of ""optimal number of players"".     2-7, best 4, rec 3-7, solo variant 30 2.3",68448,7 Wonders

It seems like it would work even better with 3 or 4 people, but we had a blast with just the 2 of us.  It was easy to learn and had a fun mix of strategy and (mostly) luck.

While that can sometimes turn on its head in this game, the core mechanics emphasize the material imbalance between the sides quite splendidly.

66295,Azeltir,10,"The best game. It's fun to teach - a walkthrough of a round of the game is pretty much what players need to know, and guiding through that is almost like playing the game!  I like how it's a game of player diplomacy, game-breaking alien powers, *and* the central importance of managing your hand to win encounters that matter. Almost every game I play ends in some type of shared victory, and with the people I play with, that's a pretty significant plus.

He makes dice actually great, by making their results the inputs into your decision-making rather than determining the effectiveness of decision outputs.  There is little more satisfying in games than kicking off a combo of tiles that lets you get and lay down four tiles or so.  The game's largest flaw, as with many Feld games, is that it feels like it should end about 20% sooner. I think I'll try removing one round from each phase some time.",84876,The Castles of Burgundy

When played *ahem* properly, this game is the best hidden role and deduction game ever, with its elegance and social jockeying.  The new edition sacrifices one of this game's greatest strengths, portability, while also replacing its beautiful cover art with George Patsouras' kind of uncanny valley-ish art.

Additionally, this is the better Puerto Rico, using simultaneous action selection and a deck of cards to get out of PR's practically solved game opening while keeping the role selection vibe strong. I still don't own this personally, but I'm always looking for a good deal on the whole set with expansions.

899938,Azeltir,8,"I really want to play this again, but it's got problems. A player can be utterly destroyed surprisingly early in the game, which must feel awful. It also is a nightmare to teach, as you basically need to go over everything before you can get started, otherwise people will get on the wrong foot.  But this is the game of betrayal and vendettas. It does it far better than any other game I've seen, and the commander mechanic for combat is wonderful.  Sadly, I will probably not get the POD expansion, as I mostly play games with people who have not read ASOIAF. Oh well!",103343,A Game of Thrones: The Board Game (Second Edition)

700617,Azilut,9,"Tzolk'in is one of the best worker placement games I have played.  The main thing that sets it apart is that each turn, you either set out workers or pull back workers, but they don't take their action until you pull them back.  The workers are sitting on gear wheels that rotate every turn, so as you leave them out longer, they will gain access to different and often better actions.  This demands careful planning on the part of the player - you need to plan ahead both to get your workers to where you want them when you want them, but also to have the right resources on hand when they get there.  In contrast to many heavy worker placement games, where the challenge comes from optimizing a dizzying array of options, Tzolkin presents you with a tight, focused economy but makes you think about what state it will be in two or three turns from now.  It hurts my brain, but it hurts so good.",126163,Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar

But oh, how I love this beautiful mess.

107568,aznsaiyan1029,9,"Very cute game with cute designs in building up lot of buildings with cards. Whoever meets all 4 objectives win the games. Expansion would make the game more interesting with more choices of buildings with elements of defense and counter against other cards. I strongly encourage making some house rule variations to balance some components of the game in the expansion. The expansion rules can really mess up the game when the card drafting pile end up with too many purple cards. You can also filter some cards in the deck to suit it to your taste. Expansion can make the game too long however in some cases.  Who would enjoy: All age group. Children friendly. Don't want to think too much and enjoy testing out their luck.  Easy to learn: 10/10 Replayability: 6/10 Theme: 7/10 Tactic: very light Personal Fun Scale: 7/10 Luck balance*: 2/10 Abstract reading**: 1/5  * score of 10 would mean no luck is required, while 0 means luck based completely  ** critical thinking and reading in comparison to classic board game such as shogi, chess, and go since I personally like simple yet delicate problem.",143884,Machi Koro

203435,azraelswrd,10,"Probably my favorite table top game because these were some of my best memories from college.  We didn't have the best cards but I had the most fun making crazy decks built around random (ie. available) cards.  I don't play competitively anymore due to a lack of players but I will leaf through a box or deck and think of something new to tweak.  I'll still buy singles every now and then either for the decks or just for the cool artwork.  Second to chess, this game has the longest shelf-life for me.  Only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because of the CCG aspect, but the game is flexible enough that you don't need the latest/greatest to have fun.",463,Magic: The Gathering

Secretly working against everyone while playing as a Cylon is extremely difficult - you find yourself attempting to reason your way out of situations, frame other players, and perform ""good"" actions in public just so others don't find you out.  Playing as a human reminds me of the game ""Paranoia."" You know there's a traitor... and you're PRETTY sure it's everyone around you. You find yourself over-analyzing, and attempting to trap people into making decisions that will reveal themselves.  I tried this game twice. I had never seen the show.

689052,azzxxxc,8,"I played v1 a few years ago (which is out of print), and happily bought v2 when it finally came out.  Apparently there are some slight tweaks/improvements, but it's so subtle that I didn't notice them.   I brought my copy of v2 to another game group's game-night.  And it took over.  we played it 3 times in a row (about 4 hours).  The ""trader"" makes it all work.  You go from and ""exploring"" game to a ""survival"" game right about the time exploring is getting comfortable to you.  Then, when the game is actually over (after the survival half of the game)... you're totally ready for another round of exploring --> especially because you know the next ""trader"" will trigger a totally different ""survival"" scenario.  There's 50 trader scenarios, which means the game can surprise you 50 times. (and if you have a short memory, like me, it will surprise you every time! :) )  Also... just because you play a scenario a second time, doesn't mean the player controlling the trader will make all the same decisions as the trader did last time.  Even the same scenario is worth playing more than once.  I recommend this to friends and try to create reasons for 3 people to get together and play.  That's the only drawback, you need more than 2 people to play.  But that can easily be a bonus because more people are more fun in this type of game. :)",10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill

Very nice game where you have the feeling of not being able to handle all the different things that happen all the time. A tight game with a lot of frustrating cards and dice rolls, and agonizing decisions. The feel that something imminent will happen soon make this a very nice co-operative game.  Much appreciated by both of us.   ---Update--- This is soo much fun. With the Dunwich expansion I think this is our favourite two player game (with two investigators each). Always nice to sink into the feeling that this game gives. Rating up from 9 to 10",15987,Arkham Horror

I love its interactive trading phase, it has just the right length for what it offers and it rewards clever trading, albeit being somewhat luck dependent. I have been playing several games now with my usual group and we all like it a lot.  I have been playing two six player games, too, using the 'Bohnanza Expansion Set' and found that the game drags on then, but it is still fun.  All that said, it's a game which should be played light heartedly. Players who are prone to make the one optimal trade may severely bog down the game and take a lot of fun out of it.",11,Bohnanza

580234,B12ain,9,"I love Ascension as my big box deck builder, and also enjoy Dominion, but Star Realms gets a higher rating for its intangibles.  Very simple and streamlined card play/strategy: There is not quite as much to teach or explain here as in Ascension or Dominion (multiple paths to victory points) since the goal of the game is so simple: blow up the other player(s).  Insanely small footprint: the entire game fits in a single deck box, add in an expansion like crisis events or gambits and you can replace the useless authority counter cards in the box with the expansion!  Cost: $15 MSRP everywhere and you can find it closer to $10 regularly, a complete game that literally costs the same or less than most expansions  Player interaction/meta: If you and your friends like direct player interaction, i am hard pressed to find a better deck builder, and almost nothing in the board game/card game world that has great direct player interaction is better for the price. You and your friends will develop a meta and it will evolve as you get more skilled in the game.  Experiment with starting authority, play the multiplayer and coop scenarios, so much to unpack and enjoy!",147020,Star Realms

240863,BaBang,9,"For such a simple game, this game was a pleasant surprise; it combines a multitude of decisions under a very simple rule set. It is a lovely melody of engine-building, tile valuation, turn-order manipulation, and a Tetris like abstract puzzle that creates some interesting blocking decisions. For casual gamers, the rules are simple and the purchasing limitations provide a focus. But for competitive gamers, there is no in-game randomization and the game invites players to think several turns ahead. The end result is a game that may just be the ultimate filler... quick, easy to learn, and enjoyed by casual and competitive gamers alike. ",163412,Patchwork
314780,BaBang,9,"Compared to the Resistance, I think this variant/version is a bit more refined than the base game. And while Avalon includes less content than the base game (no plot cards), the included variants seem more balanced. For that reason, I view Avalon as The Resistance 2.0. ",128882,The Resistance: Avalon
372380,BaBang,9,"Both in the production quality and game quality, this game is an absolute gem. It builds on the mancala mechanism by adding more modern gaming elements (set-collection, engine-building, area-control, etc) and still remains fairly easy to teach. The end result is a game with little luck, which provides a satisfyingly brain-burning experience. And where luck comes into play, the game has an ingenious auction mechanic that reduces it and maintains the fluidity of the game. Furthermore, it scales wonderfully 2-4 players.   If there was any criticism to this game, is that it can slow down with AP-prone players... but that is only because how the rich the gameplay is. For euro/abstract fans, this is a must-play game. ",157354,Five Tribes
512639,BaBang,9,"I'm not sure where I learned chess. I remember being introduced to it as a kid, trying to appreciate the game in college, and losing to a friend's young daughter in my mid-20s. In all those years, I probably never played more than a dozen games. But then, I started to play some online games out of boredom. After loosing and loosing and loosing... I got to the point where I found opponents of my skill level. And then I won.   That win motivated me to play more. And while I lost as much as I won... I started to understand the game. Sure, I understood the rules... but I never had an appreciation of the synergy between pieces or the language of the game.   Today, Chess is my most played game by far. While I don't log my plays... there hardly is a day that I don't play a game of chess or do some tactical problems. It truly is a wonderful game that has been play tested over centuries.",171,Chess
643162,BaBang,9,"A wonderful Uwe Rosenberg resource management/conversion game with multiple avenues of victory. If I had to distinguish it from his other titles, I would say this game feel quite relaxing and forgiving. Each turn, you always seem to have plenty of good options. And while other players can ""block"" specific buildings, it tends to only create inefficiencies rather than dictate the outcome of the game.   It's a very good game and one that euro/Rosenberg-fans should check out.   [Update after 12 plays]: After a dozen plays, I no longer find this game relaxing and/or forgiving. What changed? Essentially, I got better at valuing the decisions in the game. Like many games, Le Havre is about picking the most advantageous path; But unlike many games, the valuations of those paths are constantly in flux and dictated by other players decisions. And that is where the skill lies. Often pile of goods will lure you into a particular action and it will be a red-herring... something you won't have enough time to convert to money. But other times, you may get fixated on a particular path and ignore lucrative opportunities, which may be taken by your opponent instead.  I simply can't get enough of this game and still, after a dozen plays, nothing seems obvious, repetitive, or boring. My only hesitation with this game is playing it with higher player counts because of AP. But with 2-3 players, it is wonderful.",35677,Le Havre

142928,Babap,10,"Definitely my favourite.  The thing about this game is, no matter what people you tends to play with, the feeling of the game is rather unique.  And if you play with people like me, who like to change their playing style from time to time, it really boils up the mind reading element of this game.  The tension is the exciting part and very often it is the most subtle body language that actually cause trust to be built or lost, which in return cost a game to be won or lost.  With the expansions, it definitely adds more layers you can throw in as well.",41114,The Resistance
600886,Babap,9,"I personally is more attracted to the mechanic rather than the theme of the game.  The fact that you have to consider many things in your turn is what makes this game interesting.  You have to figure out what makes the best move, but then again be careful not to open a really good move for the next player by accident.   You can definitely play it as a quickie where everybody kinda do what pops into their head at first instance, or the slow and steady way where we all spend a lot of time thinking about our moves.  There are so many options in terms of how to score for VP so you can always balance between going branch out on something unique or jamming someone else's strategy.

26943,Babbler,10,"Probably my favourite worker placement game. The artwork and the components is very nice and the theme is charming enough. I can't help but compare this game to the Manhattan Project. Like the Manhattan Project, it is about managing a supply chain from grape cards >>> planted vineyards >>> crushed grapes >>> wine in cellars >>> fulfilled wines contracts. Like the Manhattan Project, it absolutely necessary to unlock your additional workers, which comes with no additional cost beyond the 4 Lira you pay beforehand. This game has two gimmicks to MP's free flowing roundless play. Viticulture goes in the opposite direction and has two rounds, thematically summer and winter, and you have mange your worker pool to not exhaust it prematurely. The Grande worker is a sort of ""free"" action, allowing you to take an action even if it is space occupied. That does mean you can take the additional worker actions at beginning of the game (a kludgy way of dealing with the problem, but it works) and then one of the conversion actions . It's an interesting choice that balances giving the players latitude in getting locked out of their supply chains spaces versus diluting worker placement's main interactive element.  Beyond that, I think what puts it top is the cards, which provides for some interesting gameplay choices and thematic flavouring. I don't recall playing the original editions, but the card options provide are another kludgy fix to the game original problem cards being useful at the beginning or the end of the game, but not both.  I've played the original ed. + Tuscany, and the choice of expansion modules ported to the essentials (made by Uwe ""lets farm and feed our people for X rounds"" Rosenberg himself!) was a good. Mama and Papa cards for variable set up with some initial choices and a little thematic flavour to boot. Aforementioned updated cards, sellable fields and solo game choices.  I think maybe they should have brought the full board, but hey (1) they keep SOMETHING back to get you to buy the he essential Tuscany ed., and it does make the game heavier, which may not be everybody's taste.

50782,Babbler,10,"A thematic euro, with a huge deck of unique and thematically appropriate cards. Playing this game does feel like you are playing a depoliticized version of Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy, with mining projects, building mines, boreholes, lakes, forest and cities and even terraforming the Galilean moons and sending an interstellar expedition.  It's not without its flaws. It is somewhat thin on player interaction beyond take that cards and some light blocking. More problematic is the achievements and milestones, this game's 6-cost developments. They feel so arbitrary and artificial.

216302,Babbler,9,"An interesting role-selection, economic snowballing game built of the model of Race of the Galaxy and San Juan. More and more, I've wanted the additional strategies of Race combined with the ease of play of San Juan, and Roll does go in that direction. The developments and worlds in Roll are more like building in San Juan, in having only one ability or granting dice to the player. That ease the requirement for iconography and makes learning easier. The role selection in this game is harsh than in Race: in RftG, it easy to get work around phases that you hoped would be selected but weren't, whereas in Roll, there's no chance to readjust.  My only complaint is that it seems to go by a bit too quick -- it maybe to easy to tableau rush, given you have to build nine worlds/developments instead of 11.",132531,Roll for the Galaxy

The theme strikes me as quite right for a game of this type: present enough to give you enough metaphors to understand the play, but it stand back and allows to players to go play the game and make their own stories. The rules are simple to teach and to play, but again it gives the players enough room to understand and calculate their moves in a reasonable amount of time. There's a lot of interaction, and much of it 'mean' (and often memorable), yet I never felt it was too heavy-handed. I like the purity of the game play, with many of it's successors have combined the area-majority scoring with something else (e.g. Belfort = area-majority + worker-placement!, etc.).

Move you piece to a new room, place the random tile, pick up the random card and do it's action, and probably rolling a random die roll to see what happens. Haunts are problematic in that they are often lop-sided. It's not that they are all broken (some are), but that the board will often evolve in such a way that one side will have to jump through some ridiculous hopes to win; this particularly true if a bunch of required room are on the board and need to be found. There are some other problems as well, such as the rules a bit of a mess. The first edition had a million and one counters that need to be sorted (the second edition wisely pared it down).  Still, I rate it highly. Why? Well, it's short and you can knock out a couple of games in an evening. The kitschy movie horror theme fits this game very well. ",10547,Betrayal at House on the Hill

Then they go through a series of events, sometimes positive (like find a station and loot the place, or a bunch of planets were you get goods from), but mostly negative (like pirates and asteroids that take plunder and destroy your ship).  As I said, it's silly. The rules were great at both teaching the game and providing nice little quotes for everybody to laugh at. While you send lots of time staring at your own player board, the theme and the game structure creates jovial atmosphere.

275326,babuino,9.8,"16-IX-2012. Por dónde empezar... Este juego está hecho para mí. En todo. Temática, aspecto, posibilidades, estrategias, mecánicas... Una maravilla.   4 fases: -A. El jugador inicial escoge entre seis acciones, muy intuitivas todas, la ejecuta (que durará unos 30 segundos) y pasa el turno al siguiente jugador que puede elegir una acción o pasar. Así hasta que todos pasan. -B. Después, si hay contacto en un mismo hexágono de dos o más jugadores se resuelve a base de toñas con un sistéma de combate muy bien implementado y nada engorroso. -C. Una fase de pago y cobro (unkeep), (que me evoca mucho al aroma del Through the Ages). -D. Y para terminar una fase de limpieza muy sencilla y fácil de seguir.  El juego en realidad gira sobre tres de detalles:  - Tres tipos de recursos (materiales, dinero y tecnología). - Todos los planetas proporcionan uno de estos tres tipos de materiales. Por medio de un sistéma ingenioso y sencillo, mandas tus trabajadores especializados a trabajar esos mundos y recolectar este tipo de recursos... Cuantos más trabajadores tengas recolectando, más recurso recibirás en la fase de mantenimiento. De tal manera que todo está muy relacionado y de nada sirve expandirte y enfatizar en un tipo de recurso si dejas de lado los otros dos.   - los discos que sirven para dos cosas: realizar tus acciones (a modo de trabajadores del Caylus) y reclamar los exágonos de la galaxia como tuyos (colocando uno de esos discos). Cuantos más discos uses, más dinero te costará pagar en la fase de unkeep.  Y ya está. Algún detalle más pero sencillo, intuitivo y con miles de posibilidades. Destacar sobre todo el manual y los iconos de todo el juego. Una currada del diseñador que habría que premiar.   Para mí un diez. Always want to play y blablabla.  20-IV-2014.Edito: pedazo de juego. Ayer jugamos con las razas alienígenas por primera vez y el juego es delicioso. No le veo ninguna pega, me amoldo al juego perfectamente y todo lo veo tan perfectamente integrado y cohesionado que me hace disfrutar la partida como en pocos juegos.  24-I-2015: Después de jugar cuatro partidas más con las razas le voy a poner una pega: si tienes mala suerte, la partida puede hacerse difícil. No siempre se tienen las mismas posibilidades de disfrutar, la suerte importa a la hora de descubrir mundos, naves, avances gratuitos... No me refiero al dado en el combate, esa suerte está asumida y agradecida, es... es otro rollo.

991301,babuino,8,"Es un juego precioso. no de mi estilo pero un must have como la copa de un pino. Colocar losetas sobre un tablero en damero... creación de reinos y templos. Excelentes ingredientes de un Knizia insuperable. Probablemente su mejor juego...pero... demasiado para mí. Me encantó jugar y no le haría una mal gesto, pero demasiado cerebral, sesudo...  Los materiales son de primera y las mecánicas son perfectas. Ningun tiempo muerto, muchisima interacción y ninguna partida igual. realmente un juego de 10, lo que pasa que no es de los míos. Aun así totalmente recomendable. ",42,Tigris & Euphrates
1048229,babuino,8,"Y yo que pensaba que este iba a ser mi juego de referencia!!!! es que me funde el cerebro. No estoy capacitado para poder preparar con anetelación, con tanta antelación, los turnos y sus ventajas. Siempre quiero tener queocos en otros sitios donde se encuentan los míos. y siempre quiero recoger algunos de ellos y no todos.... Me causa una frustración del carajo, lo cuaj no quiere decir que el juego sea malo precisamente. Vistoso es un rato, los componentes geniales y las reglas semifáciles. El problema viene con las mecánicas y mi incapacidad de poder controlar la partida. Capeo el pemporal como puedo pero nada más.  Me quedo sorprendido de lo fácil que resultan las reglas y lo fácil que resulta arrancarse a jugar todos en la mesa pero cuando empieza el tomate... ahí empiezo a fibrilar y en vez de disfrutar como un bellaco, veo girar los discos a más velocidad de la que lo hacen....  Un buen juegaco pero demasiado para mí. no me niego a una partida pero pensé yo que se le acercaría al Caverna o al Caylus...",126163,Tzolk'in: The Mayan Calendar
